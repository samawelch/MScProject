abstract = {The history of the development of statistical hypothesis testing in time series analysis is reviewed briefly and it is pointed out that the hypothesis testing procedure is not adequately defined as the procedure for statistical model identification. The classical maximum likelihood estimation procedure is reviewed and a new estimate minimum information theoretical criterion (AIC) estimate (MAICE) which is designed for the purpose of statistical identification is introduced. When there are several competing models the MAICE is defined by the model and the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters which give the minimum of AIC defined by AIC = (-2)log-(maximum likelihood) + 2(number of independently adjusted parameters within the model). MAICE provides a versatile procedure for statistical model identification which is free from the ambiguities inherent in the application of conventional hypothesis testing procedure. The practical utility of MAICE in time series analysis is demonstrated with some numerical examples.},

abstract = {Chromosomal multiple-antibiotic-resistant (Mar) mutants of Escherichia coli, selected on agar containing low concentrations of tetracycline or chloramphenicol, were 6- to 18-fold less susceptible to the fluoroquinolones than were their wild-type E. coli K-12 or E. coli C parental strains. The frequency of emergence of such mutants was at least 1,000-fold higher than that of those selected by the fluoroquinolone norfloxacin directly. When Mar mutants, but not wild-type cells, were plated on norfloxacin, mutants resistant to high levels of norfloxacin (2 micrograms/ml) appeared at a relatively high (approximately 10(-7] frequency. In addition to decreased amounts of OmpF, Mar mutants had other outer membrane protein changes and were four- to eightfold less susceptible to fluoroquinolones than was an ompF::Tn5 mutant lacking only OmpF. Accumulation of [3H]norfloxacin was more than threefold lower in the Mar mutants than in wild-type cells and twofold lower than in the OmpF-deficient derivative. These differences were not attributable to a change in the endogenous active efflux system for norfloxacin in E. coli. Norfloxacin-induced inhibition of DNA synthesis was threefold lower in intact cells of a Mar mutant than in susceptible cells, but this difference was not seen in toluene-permeabilized cells. Insertion of Tn5 into marA (min 34.05 on the chromosome) led to a return of the wild-type patterns of norfloxacin accumulation, fluoroquinolone and other antimicrobial agent susceptibilities, and outer membrane protein profile, including partial restoration of OmpF. These findings together suggest that marA-dependent fluoroquinolone resistance is linked to decreased cell permeability, only part of which can be accounted for by the reduction in OmpF. Once mutated to marA, cells can achieve high levels of quinolone resistance at a relatively high frequency.},

abstract = {The increasing worldwide consumption of pharmaceuticals and personal care products such as ibuprofen (IBU) is leading to the widespread and persistent occurrence of these chemicals and their transformation products in soils and waters. Although at low concentrations, the continuous discharge of these micropollutants and the incomplete removal by the actual wastewater treatments can provoke accumulation in the environment with risks for the trophic chain. Non-target organisms as duckweed can be used for the environmental monitoring of pharmaceutical emerging contaminants. In this work, plants of Lemna gibba L. were exposed to high (0.20 and 1 mg L− 1) and environmentally relevant (0.02 mg L− 1) concentrations of IBU to investigate their removal and metabolization capacity. The main oxidized IBU metabolites in humans (hydroxy-IBU and carboxy-IBU) were determined in the intact plants and in the growth solutions, together with non-destructive physiological parameters and phytotoxic indicators. The IBU uptake increased with the increasing of IBU concentration in the medium, but the relative accumulation of the pharmaceutical and generation of hydroxy-IBU was higher in presence of the lower IBU treatments. Carboxy-IBU was not found in the plant tissue and solutions. The changes observed in growth and photosynthetic performances were not able to induce phyto-toxic effects. Apart from a mean physical-chemical degradation of 8.2{\%}, the IBU removal by plants was highly efficient (89–92.5{\%}) in all the conditions tested, highlighting the role of L. gibba in the biodegradation of emerging contaminants.},

abstract = {Environmental toxicology has been and continues to be an important discipline (e.g., single-species testing for screening purposes). However, ecological toxicology (ecotoxicology - more realism in tests, test species and exposures) is required for predicting real world effects and for site-specific assessments. Ecotoxicology and ecology have shown similar developmental patterns over time; closer cooperation between ecologists and toxicologists would benefit both disciplines. Ecology can be incorporated into toxicology either extrinsically (separately, e.g., providing information on pre-selected test species) or intrinsically (e.g., as part of test species selection) - the latter is preferable. General guidelines for acute and chronic testing and criteria for species selection differ for ecotoxicology and environmental toxicology, and are outlined. An overall framework is proposed based on ecological risk assessment (ERA), for combining ecology and toxicology (environmental and ecological) for decision-making. Increased emphasis on ecotoxicology represents a shift from reductionist to holistic approaches. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2002 .},

@article{Malik2004,
abstract = {Heavy-metal pollution represents an important environmental problem due to the toxic effects of metals, and their accumulation throughout the food chain leads to serious ecological and health problems. Metal remediation through common physico-chemical techniques is expensive and unsuitable in case of voluminous effluents containing complexing organic matter and low metal contamination. Biotechnological approaches that are designed to cover such niches have, therefore, received great deal of attention in the recent years. Biosorption studies involving low-cost and often dead/pretreated biomass have dominated the literature and, subsequently, extensive reviews focusing on equilibrium and kinetics of metal biosorption have also come up. However, the low binding capacity of biomass for certain recalcitrant metals such as Ni and failure to effectively remove metals from real industrial effluents due to presence of organic or inorganic ligands limit this approach. At times, when pure biosorptive metal removal is not feasible, application of a judicious consortium of growing metal-resistant cells can ensure better removal through a combination of bioprecipitation, biosorption and continuous metabolic uptake of metals after physical adsorption. Such approach may lead to simultaneous removal of toxic metals, organic loads and other inorganic impurities, as well as allow optimization through development of resistant species. However, sensitivity of living cells to extremes of pH or high metal concentration and need to furnish metabolic energy are some of the major constraints of employing growing cells for bioremediation. The efforts to meet such challenges via isolation of metal-resistant bacterial/fungal strains and exploitation of organic wastes as carbon substrates have began. Recent studies show that the strains (bacteria, yeast and fungi) isolated from contaminated sites possess excellent capability of metal scavenging. Some bacterial strains possess high tolerance to various metals and may be potential candidates for their simultaneous removal from wastes. Evidently, the stage has already been set for the application of metal-resistant growing microbial cells for metal harvesting. This review focuses on the applicability of growing bacterial/fungal/algal cells for metal removal and the efforts directed towards cell/process development to make this option technically/economically viable for the comprehensive treatment of metal-rich effluents. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Environmental bacteria persist in various habitats, yet little is known about the genes that contribute to growth and survival in their respective ecological niches. Signature-tagged mutagenesis (STM) of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 coupled with a screen involving incubations of mutant strains in anoxic aquifer sediments allowed us to identify 47 genes that enhance fitness in sediments. Gene functions inferred from annotations provide us with insight into physiological and ecological processes that environmental bacteria use while growing in sediment ecosystems. Identification of the mexF gene and other potential membrane efflux components by STM demonstrated that homologues of multidrug resistance genes present in pathogens are required for sediment fitness of nonpathogenic bacteria. Further studies with a mexF deletion mutant demonstrated that the multidrug resistance pump encoded by mexF is required for resistance to antibiotics, including chloramphenicol and tetracycline. Chloramphenicol-adapted cultures exhibited mutations in the gene encoding a TetR family regulatory protein, indicating a role for this protein in regulating expression of the mexEF operon. The relative importance of mexF for sediment fitness suggests that antibiotic efflux may be a required process for bacteria living in sediment systems.},

@article{Valko2005,
abstract = {Metal-induced toxicity and carcinogenicity, with an emphasis on the generation and role of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, is reviewed. Metal-mediated formation of free radicals causes various modifications to DNA bases, enhanced lipid peroxidation, and altered calcium and sulfhydryl homeostasis. Lipid peroxides, formed by the attack of radicals on polyunsaturated fatty acid residues of phospholipids, can further react with redox metals finally producing mutagenic and carcinogenic malondialdehyde, 4-hydroxynonenal and other exocyclic DNA adducts (etheno and/or propano adducts). Whilst iron (Fe), copper (Cu), chromium (Cr), vanadium (V) and cobalt (Co) undergo redox-cycling reactions, for a second group of metals, mercury (Hg), cadmium (Cd) and nickel (Ni), the primary route for their toxicity is depletion of glutathione and bonding to sulfhydryl groups of proteins. Arsenic (As) is thought to bind directly to critical thiols, however, other mechanisms, involving formation of hydrogen peroxide under physiological conditions, have been proposed. The unifying factor in determining toxicity and carcinogenicity for all these metals is the generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. Common mechanisms involving the Fenton reaction, generation of the superoxide radical and the hydroxyl radical appear to be involved for iron, copper, chromium, vanadium and cobalt primarily associated with mitochondria, microsomes and peroxisomes. However, a recent discovery that the upper limit of “free pools” of copper is far less than a single atom per cell casts serious doubt on the in vivo role of copper in Fenton-like generation of free radicals. Nitric oxide (NO) seems to be involved in arsenite-induced DNA damage and pyrimidine excision inhibition. Various studies have confirmed that metals activate signalling pathways and the carcinogenic effect of metals has been related to activation of mainly redox - sensitive transcription factors, involving NF-kappaB, AP-1 and p53. Antioxidants (both enzymatic and non - enzymatic) provide protection against deleterious metal-mediated free radical attacks. Vitamin E and melatonin can prevent the majority of metal-mediated (iron, copper, cadmium) damage both in vitro systems and in metal - loaded animals. Toxicity studies involving chromium have shown that the protective effect of vitamin E against lipid peroxidation may be associated rather with the level of non-enzymatic antioxidants than the activity of enzymatic antioxidants. However, a very recent epidemiological study has shown that a daily intake of vitamin E of more than 400 IU increases the risk of death and should be avoided. While previous studies have proposed a deleterious pro-oxidant effect of vitamin C (ascorbate) in the presence of iron (or copper), recent results have shown that even in the presence of redox-active iron (or copper) and hydrogen peroxide, ascorbate acts as an antioxidant that prevents lipid peroxidation and does not promote protein oxidation in humans in vitro . Experimental results have also shown a link between vanadium and oxidative stress in the etiology of diabetes. The impact of zinc (Zn) on the immune system, the ability of zinc to act as an antioxidant in order to reduce oxidative stress and the neuroprotective and neurodegenerative role of zinc (and copper) in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease is also discussed. This review summarizes recent findings in the metal-induced formation of free radicals and the role of oxidative stress in the carcinogenicity and toxicity of metals},

abstract = {To combat the threat to human health and biosecurity from antimicrobial resistance, an understanding of its mechanisms and drivers is needed. Emergence of antimicrobial resistance in microorganisms is a natural phenomenon, yet antimicrobial resistance selection has been driven by antimicrobial exposure in health care, agriculture, and the environment. Onward transmission is affected by standards of infection control, sanitation, access to clean water, access to assured quality antimicrobials and diagnostics, travel, and migration. Strategies to reduce antimicrobial resistance by removing antimicrobial selective pressure alone rely upon resistance imparting a fitness cost, an effect not always apparent. Minimising resistance should therefore be considered comprehensively, by resistance mechanism, microorganism, antimicrobial drug, host, and context; parallel to new drug discovery, broad ranging, multidisciplinary research is needed across these five levels, interlinked across the health-care, agriculture, and environment sectors. Intelligent, integrated approaches, mindful of potential unintended results, are needed to ensure sustained, worldwide access to effective antimicrobials.},

abstract = {This paper reviews current information on the chronic aquatic toxicity of human pharmaceuticals and how it should be measured. Chronic toxicity tests with Cyanobacteria are likely to be sensitive surrogates for both algae and other unicellular organisms, although possibly not for higher plants. In contrast, there is little evidence of a general need to perform chronic aquatic invertebrate tests for all human pharmaceuticals, although further acute-to-chronic ratio data are required for the main therapeutic classes and modes of action of pharmaceuticals before this issue can be fully resolved. Chronic fish tests may be necessary for some substances, but it is likely that these can be focused more accurately through use of information in mammalian toxicity datasets. For some substances and modes of action, life-cycle or partial life-cycle fish tests may be more relevant than reliance on early life-stage (ELS) tests, because the ELS test is unlikely to respond adequately to all pharmaceutical modes of action. Biomarkers may be useful in focusing research and testing efforts by identifying active substances and receptors of interest in aquatic species, and they may also be useful in field surveys for helping to establish possible cause and effect relationships. QSARs have been used by several authors to predict acute toxic effects, but predictions of chronic effects are currently hampered by the paucity of available chronic data to build predictive models. There seems to be no obvious reason why mixtures of pharmaceuticals in the environment should be treated in a different way to mixtures of other potentially hazardous substances. If mixture toxicity is considered to be an important environmental issue then all substances should be considered within an appropriate risk assessment framework. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The antiviral drug Tamiflu (Oseltamivir Phosphate, OP), has been indicated by the World Health Organization as a first-line defense in case of an avian influenza pandemic. Recent studies have demonstrated that Oseltamivir Carboxylate (OC), the active metabolite of the prodrug OP, has the potential to be released into water bodies. The present laboratory study focused on basic processes governing the environmental fate of OC in surface water from two contrasting aquatic ecosystems of northern Italy, the River Po and the Venice lagoon. Results of this study confirmed the potential of OC to persist in surface water. However, addition of 5{\%} of sediments resulted in rapid OC degradation. Estimated half-life of OC in water/sediment of the River Po was 15 days. After three weeks of incubation at 20 °C, more than 8{\%} of 14C-OC evolved as 14CO2 from water/sediment samples of the River Po and Venice lagoon. At the end of the 21-day incubation period, more than 65{\%} of the 14C-residues were recovered from the liquid phase of both Po and Venice water/sediment samples. OC was moderately retained onto coarse sediments from the two sites. In water/sediment samples of the River Po and Venice lagoon treated with 14C-OC, more than 30{\%} of the 14C-residues remained water-extractable after three weeks of incubation. The low affinity of OC to sediments suggests that presence of sediments would not reduce its bioavailability to microbial degradation. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Using drugs in combination can be important in therapeutic strategies, both to decrease the risk of toxic side effects as well as to decrease the likelihood of resistance evolving. These properties are largely affected by interactions among drugs. Given the increased use of three or more drugs in clinics, we provide a review of challenges researchers face when studying higher-order drug interactions together with a review of current theoretical and methodological advances in resolving these issues. The challenges include deriving theoretical measures for interaction effects compared with single drug efficacies, disentangling higher-order emergent effects from lower-order interactions, enhancing the resolution of data to better classify interaction types, and considering practical difficulties such as measuring responses to drug combinations across a range of concentrations. The systems biology and interaction modeling approaches reviewed here offer ways to go beyond-pairwise interactions and to quantify and better understand higher-order drug interactions. However, there are many research directions yet to pursue to provide mechanistic insights and to determine the consequences of these interactions.},

abstract = {Awareness of antibiotics in wastewaters and aquatic ecosystems is growing as investigations into alternate pollutants increase and analytical techniques for detecting these chemicals improve. The presence of three antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin and cephalexin) was evaluated in both sewage effluent and environmental waters downstream from a sewage discharge. Bacteria cultured from the sewage bioreactor and receiving waters were tested for resistance against six antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, ampicillin, trimethoprim, erythromycin and trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole) and effects of short term exposure (24 h) to antibiotics on bacterial denitrification rates were examined. Antibiotics were detected entering the sewage treatment plant with varying levels of removal during the treatment process. Antibiotics were also detected in effluent entering receiving waters and detectable 500 m from the source. Among the bacteria cultured from the sewage bioreactor, resistance was displayed against all six antibiotics tested and bacteria cultured from receiving waters were resistant against two of the antibiotics tested. Rates of denitrification were observed to decrease in response to some antibiotics and not to others, though this was only observed at concentrations exceeding those likely to be found in the environment. Findings from this preliminary research have indicated that antibiotics are entering our aquatic systems and pose a potential threat to ecosystem function and potentially human health. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Human pharmaceuticals have been detected in the terrestrial environment at $\mu$g to mgkg-1 concentrations. Repeated application of sewage sludge (biosolids) and increasing reclaimed wastewater use for irrigation could lead to accumulation of these novel contaminants in soil systems. Despite this, potential phytotoxicological effects on higher plants have rarely been evaluated. These studies aimed to test effects upon germination, development, growth and physiology of two crop plants, namely radish (Raphanus sativus Spakler 3) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa All Year Around), after exposure to different, but structurally related non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) at environmentally relevant concentrations. A range of biological endpoints comprising biomass, length, water content, specific root and shoot length, root to shoot ratio, daily progress of stages of cell elongation and organ emergence (primary root, hypocotyl elongation, cotyledon emergence, cotyledon opening, and no change), as well as photosynthetic measurements were evaluated. Compounds from the fenamic acid class were found to affect R. sativus root endpoints (root length and water content), while ibuprofen affected early root development of L. sativa. In general, phytotoxicological effects on root endpoints demonstrated that impacts upon higher plants are not only compound specific, but also differ between plant species. It was found that the usage of a wide range of biological endpoints (all simple, cost-effective and ecologically relevant) were beneficial in detecting differences in plant responses to NSAID exposure. Due to paucity and discrepancy within the few previously available phytotoxicological studies with pharmaceuticals, it is now essential to allocate time and resources to consider development of suitable chronic toxicity tests, and some suggestions regarding this are presented.},

abstract = {All species have evolved in the presence of distur- bance, and thus are in a sense matched to the recurrence pattern of the perturbations. Conse- quently, disturbances within the typical range, even at the extreme of that range as defined by large, infrequent disturbances (LIDs), usually result in little long-term change to the system's fundamental character. We argue that more serious ecological consequences result from compounded perturba- tions within the normative recovery time of the community in question. We consider both physi- cally based disturbance (for example, storm, volca- nic eruption, and forest fire) and biologically based disturbance of populations, such as overharvesting, invasion, and disease, and their interactions. Dis- persal capability and measures of generation time or age to first reproduction of the species of interest seem to be the important metrics for scaling the size and frequency of disturbances among different types of ecosystems. We develop six scenarios that de- scribe communities that have been subjected to multiple perturbations, either simultaneously or at a rate faster than the rate of recovery, and appear to have entered new domains or ‘‘ecological surprises.'' In some cases, three or more disturbances seem to have been required to initiate the changed state.We argue that in a world of ever-more-pervasive anthro- pogenic impacts on natural communities coupled with the increasing certainty of global change, compounded perturbations and ecological surprises will become more common. Understanding these ecological synergisms will be basic to environmental management decisions of the 21st century. Key},

abstract = {Integrating the effects of multiple stressors and predicting their consequences for the species' survival and distribution is an important problem in ecological physiology. This review applies the concept of energy-limited tolerance to stress to develop bioenergetic markers that can assist in integrating the effects of multiple stressors and distinguishing between the moderate stress compatible with long-term survival of populations and bioenergetically unsustainable extreme stress. These markers reflect the progressive decline of the aerobic scope of an organism (defined as the fraction of the energy flux and metabolic power supporting this flux available after the basal maintenance costs of an organism are met) with increasing levels of the environmental stress. During the exposure to moderate stress (i.e., in the pejus range of the environmental conditions), the aerobic scope is positive but reduced compared with the optimum conditions. The reduction of the metabolic scope can be due to the (1) elevated costs of basal metabolism, (2) activation of the mechanisms for protection and damage repair, (3) reduced assimilation of food, and/or (4) stress-induced impacts on the aerobic pathways producing ATP. This leads to suboptimal growth and reproductive rates in the pejus range of environmental conditions and is commonly observed in food-limited and energy-limited wild populations. The tolerance windows of the organisms are delimited by the pessimum range(s) of environmental conditions in which the aerobic scope of the organism disappears (so that all available energy and metabolic capacity are used in support of basal metabolism), energy resources are depleted, and partial anaerobiosis and/or metabolic rate depression set in. The habitats where environmental conditions remain in the pessimum zone long enough to prevent consistent growth and reproduction often coincide with the species' distributional limits. Thus, focus on the bioenergetic effects of environmental stressors and their immediate consequences for fitness provides a suitable framework for integrating physiology and functional ecology and can assist in understanding the driving forces and limitations of environmental adaptation and improving assessment of ecological risk as well as environmental management in field populations facing multiple stressors.},

abstract = {The primary atrazine-sensitive site seems to be located within the chloroplast for resistant as well as susceptible plants. Atrazine inhibits the Hill reaction and its associated noncyclic photophos-phorylation, while being ineffective against cyclic photophosphorylation. N-Dealkylation causes a decrease in the inhibitory activity of atrazine, but the same reactions mentioned above were inhib-ited despite the change in molecular structure. Atrazine readily penetrates the chloroplasts of resistant as well as susceptible plants and seems to accumulate there until an equilibrium concen-tration is attained between the chloroplasts and the cytoplasm. In resistant plants such as sorghum, metabolism of atrazine very likely occurs outside the chloroplasts to form water-soluble compounds and insoluble residue, reduces the concentration of the photosynthetic inhibitor in the chloroplasts, and results in a recovery of photosynthesis. Changes in solubility of the parent atrazine, caused by its metabolism, may be of great sig-nificance in the tolerance of plants to the herbicide. he chemical and biological properties of substituted s-triazines have been discussed by Gysin and Kniisli (1960). Two substituted s-chlorotriazines widely used as selective herbicides in fields of corn and sorghum, 2-chloro-4-ethylamino-6-isopropylamino-s-tri-azine (atrazine) and 2-chloro-4,6-bis(ethylamino) -s-triazine (simazine), seem to affect higher plants in a similar manner. Their high biological activity against a wide spectrum of plants has made atrazine and simazine useful as selective herbicides. Selectivity seems to depend on the extent to which a herbicide remains in its toxic form in the plant. Therefore. the persistence and effectiveness of kill may be directly influenced by the metabolism and detoxica-tion of the herbicide in an intact plant. Metabolism and detoxication of atrazine occur in two possible ways in higher plants (Shimabukuro, 1967a). Dechlorination of atrazine and simazine in corn by the conversion of the s-chlorotriazines to their 2-hydroxy derivatives (hydroxyatrazine and hydroxysimazine) is an important detoxication mechanism (Castelfranco et al., 1961 ; Gysin and Knusli, 1960; Hamilton and Moreland, 1962; Roth, 1957). This reaction seems to be catalyzed non-enzymatically by a cyclic hydroxamate,},

abstract = {The importance of phytoplankton, benthic microalgae, fresh and salt marsh,emergent plants, and terrestrial organic matter to the estuarine food web of Plum Island Sound, Massachusetts, USA, was evaluated using the stable isotopes of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur. Three distinct regions of the estuary were examined: the oligohaline upper estuary with high freshwater inputs and fringing fresh marsh, the middle estuary with extensive salt marsh, and the lower estuary with a greater proportion of open bay and a direct connection to open ocean. In each region, sources of organic matter for pelagic and benthic aquatic consumers were compared with the range of organic matter sources available in the entire estuary. Consumers in all regions relied most heavily on locally produced organic matter. In the upper estuary, most consumers had delta(13)C values of -29 to -21 parts per thousand and delta(34)S values of about 8 parts per thousand, which indicated dependence on a mixture of fresh marsh emergent vegetation and phytoplankton from the oligohaline region. In the middle and lower estuary, consumers had delta(13)C values of -23 to -15 parts per thousand and delta(34)S values of 5 to 15 parts per thousand resembling a mixture of Spartina spp., benthic microalgae and marine phytoplankton. Terrestrial organic matter was of minimal importance in the upper estuary and was not evident in the food webs of the middle and lower estuary. The isotopic values of pelagic consumers reflected a greater dependence on phytoplankton than those of benthic consumers, which were closer to fresh or salt marsh emergent vegetation and benthic microalgae. Several of the patterns revealed by examination of organic matter sources far the food web of the Plum Island Sound estuary have implications for our general understanding of estuarine food webs. First, while there is substantial spatial heterogeneity in organic matter sources within a single estuary, consumers tend to utilize sources of organic matter produced in the same region of the estuary in which they reside. Second, consumer dependence on terrestrially derived riverine organic matter is minimal, even in the relatively small region of the estuary where its availability is the highest. Third, benthic and pelagic organisms rely on different mixes of organic matter sources.},

abstract = {A quantitative analysis of the toxicity of drugs or poisons applied jointly requires that they be administered at several dosages in mixtures containing fixed proportions of the ingredients. From a study of the dosage-mortality curves for several such mixtures, preferably in comparison with equivalent curves for the isolated active ingredients, most cases of combined action can be classified into one of three types: (1) The first type is that in which the constituents act independently and diversely, so that the toxicity of any combination can be predicted from that of the isolated components and from the association of susceptibilities to the two components. The coefficient of association can be measured experimentally and should be constant at all proportions of the ingredients. When high, the toxicity of the mixture is reduced. The form of the dosage-mortality curve has been examined for several hypothetical mixtures. Whenever the curves for the two constituents were assumed to differ in slope, there was a relatively abrupt bend in the curve for the mixture, the rectilinear segments above and below the break approaching in slope the values for the original constituents. This observation indicates that in homogeneous populations the slope of a dosage-mortality curve is of toxicological significance. Since the same numerical relations would be expected if a single poison were to have two independent lethal effects within the animal, there is theoretical basis for fitting the linear segments of a dosage-mortality curve separately when a break occurs after transformation to probits and logarithms. This argument has been extended to time-mortality experiments to explain the smoothly concave curves characteristic of natural mortality. (2) The second type of joint action is that in which the constituents act independently but similarly, so that one ingredient can be substituted at a constant ratio for any proportion of a second without altering the toxicity of the mixture. With homogeneous populations, dosage-mortality curves for the separate ingredients and for all mixtures should be parallel. Although by hypothesis the susceptibility to one ingredient is completely correlated with that to the other, mixtures in this category are more toxic than in the preceding class where association may vary from 0 to 1. The numerical relations have been illustrated by an experiment on the toxicity to the house-fly of solutions containing pyrethrin and rotenone. A mixture with a little less than four equitoxic units of pyrethrin to one of rotenone agreed closely with the definition but one in which the ingredients were about equally balanced showed a significantly greater toxicity than expected on the hypothesis of independent action, indicating the presence of synergism. (3) Synergism forms the third type of joint action, characterized by a toxicity greater than that predicted from studies on the isolated constituents. It is the reverse of antagonism, which has not been considered directly. Two methods are proposed for the analysis of synergism. The more direct is to relate equitoxic dosages of mixture to its percentage composition in terms of the more active ingredient. When both are in logarithms the relation is linear over a useful range of compositions. This procedure preserves the original structure of the experiment, can be extended readily to three or more ingredients and leads to a convenient practical result. Theoretically it is less satisfactory than a second method in which for equitoxic dosages of each mixture the content of one ingredient (A) is related to the content of the other (B.) The equation which satisfies this relation most completely is (1 +k1A) Bi=k2, where the three constants are computed from the experimental data. When the exponent i is equal to 1, only two constants need be determined and their product, k1k2, is proposed as a measure of the intensity of synergism. The synergism between a nitro-phenol and petroleum oil has been computed by both methods. For mixtures containing from 0{\textperiodcentered}5 to 5{\%} of the nitr phenol, the deposit of mixture (Dc) killing 98 {\%} of the eggs of a plant bug could be expressed adequately in terms of the percentage of the phenol (Q) as log Dc= 0{\textperiodcentered}687-0{\textperiodcentered}307 log Q, for 98{\%} of overwintering San Jose scale as log Dc= 0{\textperiodcentered}472 -0{\textperiodcentered}363 log Q. All observations, including those for a 0{\textperiodcentered}1 {\%} mixture and for oil alone which were omitted in the first method, could be fitted satisfactorily in terms of the separate ingredients. For plant bug eggs at LD50, (1+25{\textperiodcentered}6A) B= 4{\textperiodcentered}29 and for San Jose scale (1 + 66{\textperiodcentered}7 A) B= 2{\textperiodcentered}73: in both cases i= 1 and the intensity of synergism 110 and 182 respectively. The full procedure has also been applied to the constituents of seven samples of Derris root. One sample gave an unaccountably low toxicity and was omitted. The log LD 50 of ether extract for the remaining six was related to the percentage composition of two components in the extract, rotenone (A) and dehydro mixture (B.) Since the toxicity of extract could be expressed almost entirely in terms of these particular two constituents, they were then related to each other by the second method. None of the samples contained a very small proportion of one ingredient, so that several equations were equally applicable, one of them being (1+0–714A) B= 56{\textperiodcentered}1, from which the intensity of synergism was 40. The problem of measuring synergism in fumigants has been discussed briefly.},

abstract = {Biological monitoring has a long history in freshwaters, where much of the pioneering work in this field was developed over a 100 years ago—but few of the traditional monitoring tools provide the global perspective on biodiversity loss and its consequences for ecosystem functioning that are now needed. Rather than forcing existing monitoring paradigms to respond to questions they were never originally designed to address, we need to take a step back and assess the prospects for novel approaches that could be developed and adopted in the future. To resolve some of the issues with indicators currently used to inform policymakers, we highlight new biological monitoring tools that are being used, or could be developed in the near future, which (1) consider less-studied taxonomic groups, (2) are standardised across regions to allow global comparisons, and (3) measure change over multiple time points. The new tools we suggest make use of some of the key technological and logistical advances seen in recent years—including remote sensing, molecular tools, and local-to-global citizen science networks. We recommend that these new indicators should be considered in future assessments of freshwater ecosystem health and contribute to the evidence base for global to regional (and national) assessments of biodiversity and ecosystem services: for example, within the emerging framework of the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services.},

abstract = {Multidrug combinations are increasingly important in combating the spread of antibiotic-resistance in bacterial pathogens. On a broader scale, such combinations are also important in understanding microbial ecology and evolution. Although the effects of multidrug combinations on bacterial growth have been studied extensively, relatively little is known about their impact on the differential selection between sensitive and resistant bacterial populations. Normally, the presence of a drug confers an advantage on its resistant mutants in competition with the sensitive wild-type population. Here we show, by using a direct competition assay between doxycycline-resistant and doxycycline-sensitive Escherichia coli, that this differential selection can be inverted in a hyper-antagonistic class of drug combinations. Used in such a combination, a drug can render the combined treatment selective against the drug's own resistance allele. Further, this inversion of selection seems largely insensitive to the underlying resistance mechanism and occurs, at sublethal concentrations, while maintaining inhibition of the wild type. These seemingly paradoxical results can be rationalized in terms of a simple geometric argument. Our findings demonstrate a previously unappreciated feature of the fitness landscape for the evolution of resistance and point to a trade-off between the effect of drug interactions on absolute potency and the relative competitive selection that they impose on emerging resistant populations.},

Model predictions were compared to empirical results of laboratory experiments measuring interactions among thermal stress, toxin exposure, and low food on reproduction and survival of two species of cladoceran zooplankton. Stress was defined operationally as a reduction in reproduction or survival relative to optimal conditions over a 7-d period. These experiments are particularly applicable to episodic stresses such as those associated with short-term heat waves. Toxin or low food in combination with 30⚬C temperatures were generally more harmful than high temperature alone. However, most multiple stress effects were antagonistic, in that effects in combination were not as severe as predicted based on the sum or the product of their individual effects. In rare cases, interaction among stressors even diminished effects of the worst single stressor. Optimal conditions for reproduction and survival occurred at 25⚬C, high food and 0 mg liter-1 toxin (a surfactant, sodium dodecyl sulfate). Suppressive effects of stressors examined individually ranked: high temperature (30 {\$}{\^{}}\backslashcirc C) {\textgreater}{\$} SDS (10 mg liter-1 ≥ low food (∼ 100 $\mu$g C liter {\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}) {\textgreater}{\$} low temperature (20⚬C).

abstract = {The ecological risks posed by two $\beta$-diketone antibiotics (DKAs, enrofloxacin, ENR and ciprofloxacin, CPX), characterized by their long persistence in aqueous environments and known deleterious effect on model organisms such as zebrafish were analysed using Rhinella arenarum larvae. Sublethal tests were conducted using environmentally relevant concentrations of both ENR and CPX (1–1000 $\mu$g L−1) under standard laboratory conditions for 96 h. Biological endpoints and biomarkers evaluated were body size, shape, development and growth rates, and antioxidant enzymes (glutathione-S-transferase, GST; Catalase, CAT). Risk assessment was analysed based on ration quotients (RQ). The size and shape measurements of the larvae exposed to concentrations greater than 10 $\mu$g L−1 of CPX were lower compared to controls (Dunnett post hoc p {\textless} 0.05) and presented signs of emaciation. Concentrations of 1000 $\mu$g L−1of CPX induced GST activity, in contrast with inhibited GST and CAT of larvae exposed to ENR. Risk assessments indicated that concentrations greater than or equal to10 $\mu$g L−1 of CPX and ENR are ecotoxic for development, growth, detoxifying, and oxidative stress enzymes. It is suggested that additional risk assessments may provide evidence of bioaccumulation of CPX and ENR in tissues or organs of amphibian larvae by mesocosm sediment test conditions. Finally, intestinal microbiome studies should be considered to establish the mechanisms of action of both antibiotics.},

abstract = {* Pesticides can have strong deleterious impacts in fresh waters, but understanding how these effects cascade through natural ecosystems, from microbes to apex predators, is limited because research that spans multiple levels of biological organisation is rare. * We report how an accidental insecticide spill altered the structure and functioning of a river across levels ranging from genes to ecosystems. We quantified the impacts on assemblages of microbes, diatoms, macroinvertebrates and fish and measured leaf-litter decomposition rates and microbial functional potential at upstream control and downstream impacted sites 2 months after the spill. * Both direct and indirect impacts were evident across multiple levels of organisation and taxa, from the base of the food web to higher trophic levels. At the molecular level, differences in functional gene abundance within the impacted sites reflected a combination of direct and indirect effects of the pesticide, via elevated abundances of microbial populations capable of using chlorpyrifos as a resource (i.e. direct effect) and oxidising ammonia released by decaying macroinvertebrate carcasses (i.e. indirect effect). * At the base of the food chains, diatom taxa found only in the impacted sites were an order-of-magnitude larger in cell size than the largest comparable taxa in control communities, following the near extirpation of their consumers. Population biomass of the key detritivore Gammarus pulex was markedly lower, as was the rate of litter decomposition in the impacted sites. This was partially compensated for, however, by elevated microbial breakdown, suggesting another indirect food-web effect of the toxic spill. * Although many species exhibited population crashes or local extirpation, total macroinvertebrate biomass and abundance were largely unaffected due to a compensatory elevation in small tolerant taxa such as oligochaetes, and/or taxa which were in their adult aerial life stage at the time of the spill (e.g. chironomids) and thus avoided contact with the polluted waters and were able to repopulate the river quickly. Mass–abundance scaling of trophic links between consumers and resources revealed extensive restructuring within the food web. * This case study shows that pesticides can affect food-web structure and ecosystem functioning, both directly and indirectly across levels of biological organisation. It also demonstrates how an integrated assessment approach, as adopted here, can elucidate links between microbiota, macroinvertebrates and fish, for instance, thus improving our understanding of the range of biological consequences of chemical contamination in natural ecosystems.},

abstract = {Mixtures of metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) occur ubiquitously in aquatic environments, yet relatively little is known regarding their combined toxicities. Emerging reports investigating the additive mortality in metal–PAH mixtures have indicated that more-than-additive effects are equally as common as strictly-additive effects, raising concern for ecological risk assessment typically based on the summation of individual toxicities. Moreover, the current separation of focus between in vivo and in vitro studies, and fine- and coarse-scale endpoints, creates uncertainty regarding the mechanisms of co-toxicity involved in more-than-additive effects on whole organisms. Drawing from literature on metal and PAH toxicity in bacteria, protozoa, invertebrates, fish, and mammalian models, this review outlines several key mechanistic interactions likely to promote more-than-additive toxicity in metal–PAH mixtures. Namely, the deleterious effects of PAHs on membrane integrity and permeability to metals, the potential for metal–PAH complexation, the inhibitory nature of metals to the detoxification of PAHs via the cytochrome P450 pathway, the inhibitory nature of PAHs towards the detoxification of metals via metallothionein, and the potentiated production of reactive oxygenated species (ROS) in certain metal (e.g. Cu) and PAH (e.g., phenanthrenequinone) mixtures. Moreover, the mutual inhibition of detoxification suggests the possibility of positive feedback among these mechanisms. The individual toxicities and interactive aspects of contaminant transport, detoxification, and the production of ROS are herein discussed.},

We are hence tasked with the challenge to take this into consideration when investigating the ecotoxicology of pharmaceuticals. This review first provides a brief overview of the fundamental approaches for mixture toxicity assessment, which is then followed by a critical review on the empirical evidence that is currently at hand on the ecotoxicology of pharmaceutical mixtures. It is concluded that, while the classical concepts of concentration addition and independent action (response addition) provide a robust scientific footing, several knowledge gaps remain. This includes, in particular, the need for more and better empirical data on the effects of pharmaceutical mixtures on soil organisms as well as marine flora and fauna, and exploring the quantitative consequences of toxicokinetic, toxicodynamic and ecological interactions. Increased focus should be put on investigating the ecotoxicology of pharmaceutical mixtures in environmentally realistic settings.},

abstract = {Gemfibrozil is a pharmaceutical commonly found in the aquatic compartment and its presence together with a mixture of several other biologically-active drugs raises concern about the possible long-term adverse effects on biota chronically exposed. Most research focus on its effect/degradation in wastewater treatment plant, while few investigations take into account its persistence in receiving aquatic ecosystems and its effects on natural microbial communities. In this context, the present work aims to evaluate gemfibrozil biodegradation, alone or in the co-presence of naproxen, comparing its persistence in the presence/absence of the river natural microbial community. For this purpose, water samples were collected from a river Tiber stretch inside the city of Rome and located downstream from a wastewater treatment plant and used for degradation experiments. Microbiologically active or sterile water microcosms were set up and treated with 100 $\mu$g L− 1of gemfibrozil alone or in the co-presence of naproxen (100 $\mu$g L− 1), in order to evaluate gemfibrozil degradation in the different conditions. At fixed times water samplings were collected for both chemical and microbiological analysis. Moreover, the effects of the pharmaceuticals on the microbial community structure in terms of variations in its abundance and composition were also assessed. The overall results showed gemfibrozil to be a quite persistent molecule in the river water microcosms and the natural microbial community had a key role in its biodegradation. The co-presence of naproxen, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug commonly co-occurring with gemfibrozil, increased its persistence and affected negatively some bacterial groups presence.},

abstract = {Establishing causal relationships between environmental stressors and observed effects in natural systems is difficult due to the many intrinsic environmental factors that can hinder this process and because there are no widely accepted and proven approaches for determining such relationships. Several types of approaches or combinations of approaches, each with their own sets of advantages and limitations, have been applied in a variety of ecological systems to investigate possible causal relationships between stressors and effects. These include controlled laboratory studies (including acute and chronic bioassays), experimental field manipulations, field studies based on synoptic field surveys, mathematical simulation modeling, statistical associations, various combinations of laboratory, experimental, and field studies, and the ecoepidemiological (weight or evidence) approach. The use of ecoepidemiological ("forensic toxicology") principles is becoming increasingly attractive as a method to help establish causality because it does not involve the same limitations of other approaches and it can also be used to integrate disparate information within a logical framework so that scientifically and defensible regulatory decisions can be made. The objective of this Commentary series of papers on the issue on causality is to demonstrate the application of the ecoepidemiology approach, using a variety of case history studies, for establishing causal relationships between specific stressors and biological effects. For each case history provided in the following series of papers, the authors describe their study situation, summarize the results supporting a causal relationship, and then compare their study results against seven standard causal criteria.},

abstract = {Combination therapy is rarely used to counter resistance evolution in bacterial infections. An expansion of combination therapy requires knowledge of how drugs interact at inhibitory concentrations. More than 50 years ago it has been noted that if bactericidal drugs are most potent on actively dividing cells, then the inhibition of growth induced by a bacteriostatic drug should result in an overall reduction of drug efficacy when used in combination with a bactericidal drug. Our goal here was to investigate this hypothesis systematically. We first constructed time-kill curves using five different antibiotics at clinically relevant concentrations and observed antagonism between bactericidal and bacteriostatic drugs. We extended our investigation by performing a screen of pairwise combinations across 21 different antibiotics at sub-inhibitory concentrations, and found that strong antagonistic interactions are enriched significantly amongst combinations of bacteriostatic and bactericidal drugs. Finally, since our hypothesis relies on a phenotypic effect produced by different drug classes, we recreated these experiments in a microfluidic device and performed time-lapse microscopy to directly observe and quantify growth and division of individual cells under controlled antibiotic concentrations. While our single-cell observations supported the antagonism between bacteriostatic and bactericidal drugs, they revealed an unexpected variety of cellular responses to antagonistic drug combinations, suggesting that multiple mechanisms underlie this interaction.},

abstract = {The drinking water for more than 28 million people was screened for a diverse group of pharmaceuticals, potential endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), and other unregulated organic contaminants. Source water, finished drinking water, and distribution system (tap) water from 19 U.S. water utilities was analyzed for 51 compounds between 2006 and 2007. The 11 most frequently detected compounds were atenolol, atrazine, carbamazepine, estrone, gemfibrozil, meprobamate, naproxen, phenytoin, sulfamethoxazole, TCEP, and trimethoprim. Median concentrations of these compounds were less than 10 ng/L, except for sulfamethoxazole in source water (12 ng/L), TCEP in source water (120 ng/L), and atrazine in source, finished, and distribution system water (32, 49, and 49 ng/L). Atrazine was detected in source waters far removed from agricultural application where wastewater was the only known source of organic contaminants. The occurrence of compounds in finished drinking water was controlled by the type of chemical oxidation (ozone or chlorine) used at each plant. At one drinking water treatment plant, summed monthly concentrations of the detected analytes in source and finished water are reported. Atenolol, atrazine, DEET, estrone, meprobamate, and trimethoprim can serve as indicator compounds representing potential contamination from other pharmaceuticals and EDCs and can gauge the efficacy of treatment processes.},

abstract = {Pharmaceuticals are highly bioactive compounds now known to be widespread environmental contaminants. However, research regarding exposure and possible effects in non-target higher vertebrate wildlife remains scarce. The fate and behaviour of most pharmaceuticals entering our environment via numerous pathways remain poorly characterized, and hence our conception and understanding of the risks posed to wild animals is equally constrained. The recent decimation of Asian vulture populations owing to a pharmaceutical (diclofenac) offers a notable example, because the exposure route (livestock carcasses) and the acute toxicity observed were completely unexpected. This case not only highlights the need for further research, but also the wider requirement for more considered and comprehensive 'ecopharmacovigilance'. We discuss known and potential high risk sources and pathways in terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems where pharmaceutical exposure in higher vertebrate wildlife, principally birds and mammals, may occur. We examine whether approaches taken within existing surveillance schemes (that commonly target established classes of persistent or bioaccumulative contaminants) and the risk assessment approaches currently used for pesticides are relevant to pharmaceuticals, and we highlight where new approaches may be required to assess pharmaceutical-related risk.},

abstract = {In the 1960s-1980s, determination of bacterial growth rates was an important tool in microbial genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, and microbial physiology. The exciting technical developments of the 1990s and the 2000s eclipsed that tool; as a result, many investigators today lack experience with growth rate measurements. Recently, investigators in a number of areas have started to use measurements of bacterial growth rates for a variety of purposes. Those measurements have been greatly facilitated by the availability of microwell plate readers that permit the simultaneous measurements on up to 384 different cultures. Only the exponential (logarithmic) portions of the resulting growth curves are useful for determining growth rates, and manual determination of that portion and calculation of growth rates can be tedious for high-throughput purposes. Here, we introduce the program GrowthRates that uses plate reader output files to automatically determine the exponential portion of the curve and to automatically calculate the growth rate, the maximum culture density, and the duration of the growth lag phase. GrowthRates is freely available for Macintosh, Windows, and Linux. We discuss the effects of culture volume, the classical bacterial growth curve, and the differences between determinations in rich media and minimal (mineral salts) media. This protocol covers calibration of the plate reader, growth of culture inocula for both rich and minimal media, and experimental setup. As a guide to reliability, we report typical day-to-day variation in growth rates and variation within experiments with respect to position of wells within the plates.},

In terms of several monitoring studies carried out in Berlin between 1996 and 2000, PhACs such as clofibric acid, diclofenac, ibuprofen, propyphenazone, primidone and carbamazepine were detected at individual concentrations up to the ??g/l-level in influent and effluent samples from STPs and in all surface water samples collected downstream from the STPs. Under recharge conditions, several compounds were also found at individual concentrations up to 7.3 ??g/l in samples collected from groundwater aquifers near to contaminated water courses. A few of the PhACs were also identified at the ng/l-level in Berlin tap water samples. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Species diversity is important for a range of ecosystem processes and properties, including the resistance to single and multiple stressors. It has been suggested that genetic diversity may play a similar role, but empirical evidence is still relatively scarce. Here, we report the results of a microcosm experiment where four strains of the marine diatom Skeletonema marinoi were grown in monoculture and in mixture under a factorial combination of temperature and salinity stress. The strains differed in their susceptibility to the two stressors and no strain was able to survive both stressors simultaneously. Strong competition between the genotypes resulted in the dominance of one strain under both control and salinity stress conditions. The overall productivity of the mixture, however, was not related to the dominance of this strain, but was instead dependent on the treatment; under control conditions we observed a positive effect of genetic richness, whereas a negative effect was observed in the stress treatments. This suggests that interactions among the strains can be both positive and negative, depending on the abiotic environment. Our results provide additional evidence that the biodiversity-ecosystem functioning relationship is also relevant at the level of genetic diversity.},

The conceptual, methodological, review and standard research papers in this special issue reflect this emerging trend of blending ecological and ecotoxicological perspectives to assess impacts in freshwater ecosystems. * Assessing community and ecosystem impacts of chemical contaminants is complex, however, and will require approaches that explicitly consider biological and chemical diversity as well as the natural variability of environmental factors at multiple spatial and temporal scales. * Central themes of the papers in this issue are (i) the importance of indirect effects of chemical contaminants on species interactions and food webs; (ii) effects of multiple stressors, especially interactions between contaminants and environmental factors; (iii) consequences of chemical exposure on ecosystem processes such as primary production and litter decomposition; (iv) the need to account for context dependency and (v) potentially harmful community and ecosystem effects of emerging contaminants, among which nanoparticles are prominently represented. * Collectively, these papers show that integrating ecological principles into the design and implementation of ecotoxicological research is essential for assessing and predicting contaminant impacts on biological communities and ecosystems. Conversely, applied ecology and bioassessment would benefit from concepts and approaches developed in ecotoxicology and from fully embracing chemical contaminants as key drivers of community structure and ecosystem processes.},

abstract = {* River ecosystems are threatened by multiple stressors, including habitat degradation, pollution and invasive species. However, freshwater ecologists have largely disregarded the contribution of toxicants to stress in rivers, whereas ecotoxicologists have primarily examined toxicant effects in artificial systems. As a result, there is a paucity of information on the co-occurrence of organic toxicants with other stressors and on the relative importance of toxicants for overall ecological risk in rivers. * We used monitoring data for German rivers to analyse the individual and joint occurrence of four stressors: habitat degradation, invasive species, nutrient pollution and organic toxicants. All stressors were examined for ecological risks in terms of whether they exceeded low- and high-risk thresholds derived from published studies and regulatory thresholds. * Nutrients and habitat degradation exceeded low and high risk thresholds at c. 85{\%} of the sites and invasive species and organic toxicants at c. 50{\%} of the sites. At least one stressor exceeded thresholds at all sites for which data on all four stressors were available. Toxicity showed weak positive correlations with nutrients and habitat degradation (0.2 {\textless} Spearman's $\rho$ {\textless} 0.34, 0.009 {\textless} P {\textless} 0.08). The risks of ecological effects arising from habitat degradation and invasive species were higher in lowland rivers, particularly for invasive species. * Our assessment shows that organic toxicants contribute notably to risks of ecological effects in rivers, to a similar extent as invasive species, although habitat degradation and nutrients are the dominant stressors. Exposure to multiple stressors is the typical situation prevailing in rivers. Consequently, mitigation measures focusing on individual stressors may not be effective at reducing ecological risks. This suggests that integrating concepts and data from freshwater ecology and ecotoxicology is essential to meet the challenge of managing multiple stressors in river ecosystems.},

abstract = {Cocktail effects and synergistic interactions of chemicals in mixtures are an area of great concern to both the public and regulatory authorities. The main concern is whether some chemicals can enhance the effect of other chemicals, so that they jointly exert a larger effect than predicted. This phenomenon is called synergy. Here we present a review of the scientific literature on three main groups of environmentally relevant chemical toxicants: pesticides, metal ions and antifouling compounds. The aim of the review is to determine 1) the frequency of synergy, 2) the extent of synergy, 3) whether any particular groups or classes of chemicals tend to induce synergy, and 4) which physiological mechanisms might be responsible for this synergy. Synergy is here defined as mixtures with minimum two-fold difference between observed and predicted effect concentrations using Concentration Addition (CA) as a reference model and including both lethal and sub-lethal endpoints. The results showed that synergy occurred in 7{\%}, 3{\%} and 26{\%} of the 194, 21 and 136 binary pesticide, metal and antifoulants mixtures included in the data compilation on frequency. The difference between observed and predicted effect concentrations was rarely more than 10-fold. For pesticides, synergistic mixtures included cholinesterase inhibitors or azole fungicides in 95{\%} of 69 described cases. Both groups of pesticides are known to interfere with metabolic degradation of other xenobiotics. For the four synergistic metal and 47 synergistic antifoulant mixtures the pattern in terms of chemical groups inducing synergy was less clear. Hypotheses in terms of mechanisms governing these interactions are discussed. It was concluded that true synergistic interactions between chemicals are rare and often occur at high concentrations. Addressing the cumulative rather than synergistic effect of co-occurring chemicals, using standard models as CA, is therefore regarded as the most important step in the risk assessment of chemical cocktails.},

The findings of CAT in such diverse prokaryotes as Proteus mirabilis, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, Streptomyces sp., and a soil Flavobacterium has led to speculation concerning the origin and evolution of the more commonly observed CAT variants specified by plasmids in clinically important bacteria. To provide a more solid basis for studying the evolution and spread of CAT within prokaryotes we chose to determine the complete amino acid sequence of a type I variant of CAT, the variant known to be associated with most F-like plasmids conferring chloramphenicol resistance. The sequence has been determined by combining the results obtained from manual and automated sequential degradation with those obtained by mass spectrometry of peptides generated by enzymatic digestion. The directly determined primary structure is identical with that predicted by the DNA sequence analysis of the chloramphenicol resistance transponson Tn9 known to specify a type I variant of chloramphenicol acetyltransferase.},

In Braunschweig, Germany, wastewater has been irrigated continuously for more than 45 years. In the winter time only the effluent of the sewage treatment plant (STP) of Braunschweig is used for irrigation, while during summer digested sludge is mixed with the effluent. In the present case study six wells and four lysimeters located in one of the irrigated agricultural fields were monitored with regard to the occurrence of 52 pharmaceuticals and two personal care products (PPCPs; e.g. betablockers, antibiotics, antiphlogistics, carbamazepine, musk fragrances, iodinated contrast media (ICM) and estrogens). No differences in PPCP pollution of the groundwater were found due to irrigation of STP effluents with and without addition of digested sludge, because many polar compounds do not sorb to sludge and lipophilic compounds are not mobile in the soil-aquifer. Most of the selected PPCPs were never detected in any of the lysimeter or groundwater samples, although they were present in the treated wastewater irrigated onto the fields. In the groundwater and lysimeter samples primarily the ICM diatrizoate and iopamidol, the antiepileptic carbamazepine and the antibiotic sulfamethoxazole were detected up to several ??g l-1, while the acidic pharmaceuticals, musk fragrances, estrogens and betablockers were likely sorbed or transformed while passing the top soil layer. Potential estrogenic effects are likely to disappear after irrigation, since the most potent steroid estrogens were not measurable. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The carbon cycle modulates climate change via the regulation of atmospheric CO2, and represents one of the most important ecosystem services of value to humans. However, considerable uncertainties remain concerning potential feedbacks between the biota and the climate. We developed theoretical models derived from the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE), and tested them in an ecosystem-level manipulative experiment in freshwater mesocosms. The year-long experiment simulated a warming scenario (A1B; [IPCC, 2007]) expected by the end of the century. The key components of the carbon cycle - that is gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER) and CH4efflux (ME) - measured in our experiment were all strongly related to temperature. Their temperature dependence was typically constrained by the average activation energy of their particular metabolic pathway, and as predicted by our models, this increased progressively for GPP, ER and ME. Warming of 4 C decreased the sequestration of CO2by 13{\%}, increased the fraction of primary production effluxing as methane by 20{\%} and the fraction of ER as methane by 9{\%}, in line with the offset in their respective activation energies. Because methane has 21 times the greenhouse gas radiative potential of CO2, these results suggest aquatic ecosystems could drive a previously unknown positive feedback between warming and the carbon cycle. We then used a series of global data compilations of measurements of rates of primary production and respiration to better understand the temperature dependence of the carbon cycle in other aquatic ecosystems and to compare them with data from terrestrial systems. Our experimental results were mirrored by our global data compilations, with the effective activation energy for marine and freshwater primary production identical to GPP measured in our experiment. Similarly, the temperature dependences of respiration in estuaries, lakes and the ocean were indistinguishable from that of ER in our experiment. Finally, our study suggests that the temperature dependence of primary production and respiration in aquatic ecosystems might differ from those in terrestrial ecosystems, and this could be crucial in predicting the future response of the carbon cycle in these different systems to global warming. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {In light of the Current rising mean temperatures and fluctuations in temperature extremes involved in global climate change, a cause-and-effect understanding of the temperature-dependent impacts of additional environmental stressors on marine life is crucial for the elaboration of how marine ecosystems will shape in the future. The thermal environment plays a direct role in the distribution and survival of marine ectotherms through the temperature-dependent effects on their physiology, as well as indirectly by affecting the organism's susceptibility to other biotic and abiotic stressors. We review studies that have investigated the effects of temperature and anthropogenic pollution by trace metals, with a focus on metabolic regulation as a major mechanism that underlies the interactive effects of temperature and metals on the physiology and survival of ectotherms. These, studies suggest that impairment of energy metabolism plays a key role in the synergistic effects of these stressors, and we elaborate a mechanistic framework for understanding these interactions. Furthermore, the present study seeks to provide an impetus for future investigations in order to define more precisely the physiological mechanisms and functional properties of temperature-pollution interactions.},

Contrasting results have been reported on the toxicity of IBU on aquatic biomonitor plants such as duckweed, and no data about IBU detection and metabolism in plants has been reported. In this work, the effects of 1 mg L −1 IBU on Lemna gibba L. were monitored in an 8-day laboratory test. In particular, an increase in frond number (+12{\%}) and multiplication rate (+10{\%}) while no variations in photosynthetic pigment content were observed. Moreover, UPLC-HRMS analysis of the presence of IBU and its metabolites in plants and in the growth medium was performed. The results showed that, besides IBU, 11 IBU metabolites were detected in plants. Among the IBU metabolites, hydroxyl-and dihydroxyl-IBU were found, whereas carboxyl-IBU was undetectable. Interestingly, some IBU metabolites were detected in the plant growth solution at the end of the IBU treatment, while no IBU products were found in the IBU solution without plants, suggesting a role for L. gibba in IBU metabolism. The findings of this work represent an important step for a better evaluation of the effects of IBU and its metabolites in duckweed, with notable implications for the eco-toxicological assessment of IBU in the aquatic ecosystem.},

abstract = {s-Triazine ring compounds are common industrial chemicals: pesticides, resin intermediates, dyes, and explosives. The fate of these compounds in the environment is directly correlated with the ability of microbes to metabolize them. Microbes metabolize melamine and the triazine herbicides such as atrazine via enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis reactions. Hydrolytic removal of substituents on the s-triazine ring is catalyzed by enzymes from the amidohydrolase superfamily and yields cyanuric acid as an intermediate. Cyanuric acid is hydrolytically processed to yield 3 mol each of ammonia and carbon dioxide. In those cases studied, the genes underlying the hydrolytic reactions are localized to large catabolic plasmids. One such plasmid, pADP-1 from Pseudomonas sp. ADP, has been completely sequenced and contains the genes for atrazine catabolism. Insertion sequence elements play a role in constructing different atrazine catabolic plasmids in different bacteria. Atrazine chlorohydrolase has been purified to homogeneity from two sources. Recombinant Escherichia coli strains expressing atrazine chlorohydrolase have been constructed and chemically cross-linked to generate catalytic particles used for atrazine remediation in soil. The method was used for cleaning up a spill of 1,000 pounds of atrazine to attain a level of herbicide acceptable to regulatory agencies.},

abstract = {If an organism does not feed, it dies of starvation. Even though some insecticides which are used to control pests in agriculture can interfere with feeding behavior of insects and other invertebrates, the link from chemical exposure via affected feeding activity to impaired life history traits, such as survival, has not received much attention in ecotoxicology. One of these insecticides is the neonicotinoid imidacloprid, a neurotoxic substance acting specifically on the insect nervous system. We show that imidacloprid has the potential to indirectly cause lethality in aquatic invertebrate populations at low, sublethal concentrations by impairing movements and thus feeding. We investigated feeding activity, lipid content, immobility, and survival of the aquatic arthropod Gammarus pulex under exposure to imidacloprid. We performed experiments with 14 and 21 days duration, both including two treatments with two high, one day pulses of imidacloprid and one treatment with a low, constant concentration. Feeding of G. pulex as well as lipid content were significantly reduced under exposure to the low, constant imidacloprid concentration (15 µg/L). Organisms were not able to move and feed--and this caused high mortality after 14 days of constant exposure. In contrast, feeding and lipid content were not affected by repeated imidacloprid pulses. In these treatments, animals were mostly immobilized during the chemical pulses but did recover relatively fast after transfer to clean water. We also performed a starvation experiment without exposure to imidacloprid which showed that starvation alone does not explain the mortality in the constant imidacloprid exposure. Using a multiple stressor toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic modeling approach, we showed that both starvation and other toxic effects of imidacloprid play a role for determining mortality in constant exposure to the insecticide.},

abstract = {Many studies have recorded phenotypic changes in natural populations and attributed them to climate change. However, controversy and uncertainty has arisen around three levels of inference in such studies. First, it has proven difficult to conclusively distinguish whether phenotypic changes are genetically based or the result of phenotypic plasticity. Second, whether or not the change is adaptive is usually assumed rather than tested. Third, inferences that climate change is the specific causal agent have rarely involved the testing - and exclusion - of other potential drivers. We here review the various ways in which the above inferences have been attempted, and evaluate the strength of support that each approach can provide. This methodological assessment sets the stage for 11 accompanying review articles that attempt comprehensive syntheses of what is currently known - and not known - about responses to climate change in a variety of taxa and in theory. Summarizing and relying on the results of these reviews, we arrive at the conclusion that evidence for genetic adaptation to climate change has been found in some systems, but is still relatively scarce. Most importantly, it is clear that more studies are needed - and these must employ better inferential methods - before general conclusions can be drawn. Overall, we hope that the present paper and special issue provide inspiration for future research and guidelines on best practices for its execution.},

abstract = {This paper reviews regulatory requirements and recent case studies to illustrate how the risk assessment (RA) of chemical mixtures is conducted, considering both the effects on human health and on the environment.

Also the current and potential future use of novel tools (Adverse Outcome Pathways, in silico tools, toxicokinetic modelling, etc.) in the RA of combined effects were reviewed. The assumptions made in the RA, predictive model specifications and the choice of toxic reference values can greatly influence the assessment outcome, and should therefore be specifically justified. Novel tools could support mixture RA mainly by providing a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of combined effects. Nevertheless, their use is currently limited because of a lack of guidance, data, and expertise. More guidance is needed to facilitate their application. As far as the authors are aware, no prospective RA concerning chemicals related to various regulatory sectors has been performed to date, even though numerous chemicals are registered under several regulatory frameworks.},

abstract = {Several sigmoidal functions (logistic, Gompertz, Richards, Schnute, and Stannard) were compared to describe a bacterial growth curve. They were compared statistically by using the model of Schnute, which is a comprehensive model, encompassing all other models. The t test and the F test were used. With the t test, confidence intervals for parameters can be calculated and can be used to distinguish between models. In the F test, the lack of fit of the models is compared with the measuring error. Moreover, the models were compared with respect to their ease of use. All sigmoidal functions were modified so that they contained biologically relevant parameters. The models of Richards, Schnute, and Stannard appeared to be basically the same equation. In the cases tested, the modified Gompertz equation was statistically sufficient to describe the growth data of Lactobacillus plantarum and was easy to use. Predictive modeling is a promising field of food microbiology. Models are used to describe the behavior of microorganisms under different physical or chemical conditions such as temperature, pH, and water activity. These models allow the prediction of microbial safety or shelf life of products, the detection of critical parts of the production and distribution process, and the optimization of production and distribution chains. In order to build these models, growth has to be measured and modeled. Bacterial growth often shows a phase in which the specific growth rate starts ata value of zero and then accelerates to a maximal value (um) in a certain period of time, resulting in a lag time (A). In addition, growth curves contain a final phase in which the rate decreases and finally reaches zero, so that an asymptote (A) is reached. When the growth curve is defined as the logarithm of the number of organisms plotted against time, these growth rate changes result in a sigmoidal curve (Fig. 1), with a lag phase just after t = 0 followed by an exponential phase and then by a stationary phase. Growth curves are found in a wide range of disciplines, such as fishery research, crop science, and biology. Most living matter grows with successive lag, growth, and asymp-totic phases; examples of quantities that follow such growth curves are the length or mass of a human, a potato, or a fish and the extent of a population of fish or microorganisms. In addition, these sigmoidal curves are used in medical science for dose-mortality relations. To describe such a curve and to reduce measured data to a limited number of interesting parameters, investigators need adequate models. A number of growth models are found in the literature, such as the models of Gompertz (7), Richards (14), Stannard et al. (17), Schnute (16), and the logistic model and others (15). These models describe only the number of organisms and do not include the consumption of substrate as a model based on the Monod equation would do. The substrate level is not of interest in our application, as we assume that there is sufficient substrate to reach intolerable numbers of organisms. Besides the lag period and the asymptotic value, another valuable parameter of the growth curve is the maximum specific growth rate (Um). Since the logarithm of the number * Corresponding author. is used, lUY is given by the slope of the line when the organisms grow exponentially. Usually this parameter is estimated by deciding subjectively which part of the curve is approximately linear and then determining the slope of this curve section, eventually by linear regression (Table 1). A better method is to describe the entire set of data with a growth model and then estimate p,,, X, and A from the model. Some authors indeed use growth models to describe their data (Table 1). These models describe the number of organisms (N) or the logarithm of the number of organisms [log(N)] as a function of time. The motivation for the decision to use a given model is usually not stated. Only Gibson et al. (5) found better results by a fitting procedure with the Gompertz model when they compared that model with the logistic model. A large number of models as given in Table 1 are used, all more or less complicated and with different numnbers of parameters. It can be expected that a difference in the results of the models for our application exists. Besides, the models are not written in terms of growth rate, lag time, and asymptotic value, which makes interpretation of the parameter values difficult. The objective of this work is to evaluate similarities and differences between the models and to deal with the question of which model(s) can be used, on the basis of statistical reasoning. The models are rewritten in such a way that they contain parameters that are microbiologically relevant.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, microscopic plastic debris, known as microplastics, emerged as a contaminant of concern in marine and freshwater ecosystems. Although regularly detected in aquatic environments, the toxicity of those synthetic particles is not well understood. To address this, we investigated whether the exposure to microplastics adversely affects the amphipod Gammarus pulex, a key freshwater invertebrate. Juvenile (6–9 mm) and adult (12–17 mm) individuals were exposed to irregular, fluorescent polyethylene terephthalate fragments (PET, 10–150 $\mu$m; 0.8–4,000 particles mL−1) for 24 h. Results show that body burden after 24 h depends on the dose and age of G. pulex with juveniles ingesting more microplastics than adults. After chronic exposure over 48 d, microplastics did not significantly affect survival, development (molting), metabolism (glycogen, lipid storage) and feeding activity of G. pulex. This demonstrates that even high concentrations of PET particles did not negatively interfere with the analyzed endpoints. These results contradict previous research on marine crustaceans. Differences may result from variations in the exposure regimes (e.g., duration, particle concentrations), plastic characteristics (e.g., type, size, shape, additives) as well as the species-specific morphological, physiological and behavioral traits. As a detritivorous shredder G. pulex is adapted to feed on non-digestible materials and might, therefore, be less sensitive towards exposure to synthetic particles. Accordingly, we argue that the autecology needs to be taken into account and that research should focus on identifying traits that render species susceptible to microplastic exposure. We investigated the microplastics uptake and chronic toxicity of PET microplastics in Gammarus pulex. Despite high particle uptake, no effects on survival, molting, energy metabolism and feeding activity were observed.},

abstract = {Carrying capacity encompasses a broad collection of approaches used to better understand biotic interactions in ecosystems and is often applied with no explicit regard to its historical origin. In this paper, we reviewed the primary literature to examine how carrying capacity is applied in ecology. We focused our review on ecosystem studies-studies that frame their results at the ecosystem level-published after the 1950s and highlight emerging trends of this concept. We found that while carrying capacity offers some underlying commonalities, a wide range of definitions and approaches hinders a unified framework to better understand biotic ecosystem interactions. Not surprisingly, these studies most often use K-the number of individuals that the environment "can support" in a given area-to define carrying capacity, despite considerable ambiguity and uncertainty in this approach. Furthermore, the studies that we reviewed spanned several levels of ecological organization: molecules to communities and up to landscapes. To add further complexity, it is not clear whether carrying capacity was intended as a dynamic concept subject to temporal variability as it was often applied in the reviewed studies. We found that carrying capacity is most often applied to studies in conservation biology, rangeland and wildlife management, aquaculture, and fisheries biology. We explore ecosystem level responses to implications of "carrying capacity" overshoot and discuss proposed mechanisms that govern ecosystem carrying capacity. We discuss the usefulness of the concept and end with suggestions to improve carrying capacity's general application in ecosystem studies.},

abstract = {Abstract Pesticides and deposited fine sediment have been associated independently with changes in relative abundance and number of sensitive species in aquatic ecosystems, but the interplay between these stressors in agricultural streams is poorly understood. We used a 28-d experiment in outdoor streamside mesocosms to examine the effects of varying levels of fine sediment and a glyphosate-based herbicide on 2 important aspects of macroinvertebrate community dynamics, invertebrate drift and adult insect emergence. We applied 4 levels of each stressor in a full factorial, repeated-measures design (4 glyphosate × 4 sediment levels × 2 replicates of each treatment combination). We focused on the propensities of the invertebrates to drift or emerge (number drifting per mesocosm/benthic individuals per m2). Sediment addition affected drift propensities of 4 of the 10 most common invertebrate taxa, community-level measures of drift (total taxon and Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera, Trichoptera [EPT] richness) and adult emergence (total propensity and taxon richness), whereas glyphosate addition affected drift propensity of only 1 taxon. These results suggest that glyphosate entering streams during terrestrial herbicide operations may be less problematic for aquatic invertebrate community dynamics than fine sediment from catchment erosion. No significant sediment × glyphosate interaction was detected for any individual taxon drift propensity or community-level drift or emergence measure, indicating that the 2 stressors acted additively, rather than synergistically or antagonistically. The dynamic measures (invertebrate drift and adult insect emergence propensities) often showed the opposite pattern compared to benthic invertebrate densities in the same experiment, a result highlighting the value of using dynamic aspects of stream invertebrate communities to identify mechanisms underlying stressor effects on benthic standing stocks.

abstract = {The accelerating rate of global change has focused attention on the cumulative impacts of novel and extreme environ- mental changes (i.e. stressors), especially in marine ecosystems. As integrators of local catchment and regional pro- cesses, freshwater ecosystems are also ranked highly sensitive to the net effects of multiple stressors, yet there has not been a large-scale quantitative synthesis. We analysed data from 88 papers including 286 responses of freshwater ecosystems to paired stressors and discovered that overall, their cumulative mean effect size was less than the sum of their single effects (i.e. an antagonistic interaction). Net effects of dual stressors on diversity and functional perfor- mance response metrics were additive and antagonistic, respectively. Across individual studies, a simple vote-count- ing method revealed that the net effects of stressor pairs were frequently more antagonistic (41{\%}) than synergistic (28{\%}), additive (16{\%}) or reversed (15{\%}). Here, we define a reversal as occurring when the net impact of two stressors is in the opposite direction (negative or positive) from that of the sum of their single effects. While warming paired with nutrification resulted in additive net effects, the overall mean net effect of warming combined with a second stressor was antagonistic. Most importantly, the mean net effects across all stressor pairs and response metrics were consistently antagonistic or additive, contrasting the greater prevalence of reported synergies in marine systems. Here, a possible explanation for more antagonistic responses by freshwater biota to stressors is that the inherent greater environmental variability of smaller aquatic ecosystems fosters greater potential for acclimation and co-adap- tation to multiple stressors.},

abstract = {Methane (CH(4)) and carbon dioxide (CO(2)) are the dominant gaseous end products of the remineralization of organic carbon and also the two largest contributors to the anthropogenic greenhouse effect. We investigated whether warming altered the balance of CH(4) efflux relative to gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (ER) in a freshwater mesocosm experiment. Whole ecosystem CH(4) efflux was strongly related to temperature with an apparent activation energy of 0.85 eV. Furthermore, CH(4) efflux increased faster than ER or GPP with temperature, with all three processes having sequentially lower activation energies. Warming of 4 degrees C increased the fraction of GPP effluxing as CH(4) by 20{\%} and the fraction of ER as CH(4) by 9{\%}, in line with the offset in their respective activation energies. Because CH(4) is 21 times more potent as a greenhouse gas, relative to CO(2), these results suggest freshwater ecosystems could drive a previously unknown positive feedback between warming and the carbon cycle.},

Quantitative relationships of the intrinsic molecular properties of the environmental micropollutants with biological responses are established, e.g., water solubility, partition coefficient, pi constant, sigma constant, ecological magnification, biodegradability index, and comparative detoxication mechanisms, respectively. Water solubility, pi constant, and sigma constant are the most significant factors and control the biological responses of the food chain members. Water solubility and pi constant control the degree of bioaccumulation, and sigma constant limits the metabolism of the xenobiotics via microsomal detoxication enzymes. These highly significant correlations should be useful for predicting environmental fate of organic chemicals.},

abstract = {Among the different pharmaceuticals present in soil and water ecosystems as micro-contaminants, considerable attention has been paid to antibiotics, since their increasing use and the consequent development of multi-resistant bacteria pose serious risks to human and veterinary health. Moreover, once they have entered the environment, antibiotics can affect natural microbial communities. The latter play a key role in fundamental ecological processes, most importantly the maintenance of soil and water quality. In fact, they are involved in biogeochemical cycling and organic contaminant degradation thanks to their large reservoir of genetic diversity and metabolic capability. When antibiotics occur in the environment, they can hamper microbial community structure and functioning in different ways and have both direct (short-term) and indirect (long-term) effects on microbial communities. The short-term ones are bactericide and bacteriostatic actions with a consequent disappearance of some microbial populations and their ecological functioning. The indirect impact includes the development of antibiotic resistant bacteria and in some cases bacterial strains able to degrade them by metabolic or co-metabolic processes. Biodegradation makes it possible to completely remove a toxic compound from the environment if it is mineralized. Several factors can influence the significance of such direct and indirect effects, including the antibiotic's concentration, the exposure time, the receiving ecosystem (e.g. soil or water) and the co-occurrence of other antibiotics and/or other contaminants. This review describes the current state of knowledge regarding the effects of antibiotics on natural microbial communities in soil and water ecosystems.},

Rather than just measure an overall effect of diversity, we separately estimate the contributions of different species interactions. This is especially important when both positive and negative interactions occur or where there are patterns in the interactions. Based on different biological assumptions, we can test for different patterns of interaction that correspond to the roles of evenness, functional groups, and functional redundancy. These more parsimonious descriptions can be especially useful in identifying general diversity–function relationships in communities with large numbers of species. We provide an example of the application of the modeling framework. These models describe community-level performance and thus do not require separate measurement of the performance of individual species. This flexible modeling approach can be tailored to test many hypotheses in biodiversity research and can suggest the interaction mechanisms that may be acting.},

abstract = {Microbes are the unseen majority in soil and comprise a large portion of life{\~{O}}s genetic diversity. Despite their abundance, the impact of soil microbes on ecosystem processes is still poorly understood. Here we explore the various roles that soil microbes play in terrestrial ecosystems with special emphasis on their contribution to plant productivity and diversity. Soil microbes are important regulators of plant productivity, especially in nutrient poor ecosystems where plant symbionts are responsible for the acquisition of limiting nutrients. Mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen-fixing bacteria are responsible for c. 5-20{\%} (grassland and savannah) to 80{\%} (temperate and boreal forests) of all nitrogen, and up to 75{\%} of phosphorus, that is acquired by plants annually. Free-living microbes also strongly regulate plant productivity, through the mineralization of, and competition for, nutrients that sustain plant productivity. Soil microbes, including microbial pathogens, are also important regulators of plant community dynamics and plant diversity, determining plant abundance and, in some cases, facilitating invasion by exotic plants. Conservative estimates suggest that c. 20 000 plant species are completely dependent on microbial symbionts for growth and survival pointing to the importance of soil microbes as regulators of plant species richness on Earth. Overall, this review shows that soil microbes must be considered as important drivers of plant diversity and productivity in terrestrial ecosystems.},

abstract = {In a study conducted by the US Geological Survey and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 24 water samples were collected at selected locations within a drinking-water-treatment (DWT) facility and from the two streams that serve the facility to evaluate the potential for wastewater-related organic contaminants to survive a conventional treatment process and persist in potable-water supplies. Stream-water samples as well as samples of raw, settled, filtered, and finished water were collected during low-flow conditions, when the discharge of effluent from upstream municipal sewage-treatment plants accounted for 37-67{\%} of flow in stream 1 and 10-20{\%} of flow in stream 2. Each sample was analyzed for 106 organic wastewater-related contaminants (OWCs) that represent a diverse group of extensively used chemicals. Forty OWCs were detected in one or more samples of stream water or raw-water supplies in the treatment plant; 34 were detected in more than 10{\%} of these samples. Several of these compounds also were frequently detected in samples of finished water; these compounds include selected prescription and non-prescription drugs and their metabolites, fragrance compounds, flame retardants and plasticizers, cosmetic compounds, and a solvent. The detection of these compounds suggests that they resist removal through conventional water-treatment processes. Other compounds that also were frequently detected in samples of stream water and raw-water supplies were not detected in samples of finished water; these include selected prescription and non-prescription drugs and their metabolites, disinfectants, detergent metabolites, and plant and animal steroids. The non-detection of these compounds indicates that their concentrations are reduced to levels less than analytical detection limits or that they are transformed to degradates through conventional DWT processes. Concentrations of OWCs detected in finished water generally were low and did not exceed Federal drinking-water standards or lifetime health advisories, although such standards or advisories have not been established for most of these compounds. Also, at least 11 and as many as 17 OWCs were detected in samples of finished water. Drinking-water criteria currently are based on the toxicity of individual compounds and not combinations of compounds. Little is known about potential human-health effects associated with chronic exposure to trace levels of multiple OWCs through routes such as drinking water. The occurrence in drinking-water supplies of many of the OWCs analyzed for during this study is unregulated and most of these compounds have not been routinely monitored for in the Nation's source- or potable-water supplies. This study provides the first documentation that many of these compounds can survive conventional water-treatment processes and occur in potable-water supplies. It thereby provides information that can be used in setting research and regulatory priorities and in designing future monitoring programs. The results of this study also indicate that improvements in water-treatment processes may benefit from consideration of the response of OWCs and other trace organic contaminants to specific physical and chemical treatments. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This detailed study of dissolved and particulate metal fluxes from adits, drains and streams in the River Tamar catchment, southwest England, showed that seven specific sources, of the 25 adits and streams surveyed, accounted for more than 75{\%} each of the 13 t a- 1Fe, 4.3 t a- 1Mn, 4.2 t a- 1Cu, 3.6 t a- 1Zn and 1.4 t a- 1As that we estimated to be discharged annually from the abandoned metalliferous mining area centred around Calstock and Gunnislake. Upstream of this study area, widespread multi-metallic mineralisation contributed to the flux of Fe, Mn, As, Co, Cu and Zn within the River Tamar. Simple mass balance calculations indicated that a large proportion (≥ 50{\%} for most dissolved and particulate metals) of the metal flux in the River Tamar was unaccounted for by our survey, and therefore is likely to have an important diffuse component, which is subject to ongoing investigations. Potential impacts of mine contamination on the estuarine environment are discussed.

abstract = {Increased demands for potable water, especially where supplies are drawn from lowland rivers has necessitated a greater degree of water re-use. As water undertakings have a duty to maintain the wholesome quality of potable water supplies, increasing concern is being expressed over the presence of organic micro-contaminants (contaminants found at microgram litre-1 concentrations). This study outlines some of the problems encountered in assessing the risk from pharmaceutical chemicals which might enter the water cycle from domestic and industrial sources. Analytical chemistry was of value for only a few of the 200 compounds studied. However, much useful information was derived from the human metabolic routes of the drugs and is collated in Appendix I. Biodegradation studies and other ecotoxicity/environmental toxicology data may be required to a greater extent in the future. Particular consideration is given to vulnerable sections of the population.},

abstract = {Phytoplankton are key components of aquatic ecosystems, fixing CO2 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and supporting secondary production, yet relatively little is known about how future global warming might alter their biodiversity and associated ecosystem functioning. Here, we explore how the structure, function, and biodiversity of a planktonic metacommunity was altered after five years of experimental warming. Our outdoor mesocosm experiment was open to natural dispersal from the regional species pool, allowing us to explore the effects of experimental warming in the context of metacommunity dynamics. Warming of 4°C led to a 67{\%} increase in the species richness of the phytoplankton, more evenly-distributed abundance, and higher rates of gross primary productivity. Warming elevated productivity indirectly, by increasing the biodiversity and biomass of the local phytoplankton communities. Warming also systematically shifted the taxonomic and functional trait composition of the phytoplankton, favoring large, colonial, inedible phytoplankton taxa, suggesting stronger top-down control, mediated by zooplankton grazing played an important role. Overall, our findings suggest that temperature can modulate species coexistence, and through such mechanisms, global warming could, in some cases, increase the species richness and productivity of phytoplankton communities.},

abstract = {The use of pesticides for crop protection may result in the presence of toxic residues in environmental matrices. In the aquatic environment, pesticides might freely dissolve in the water or bind to suspended matter and to the sediments, and might be transferred to the organisms' tissues during bioaccumulation processes, resulting in adverse consequences to non-target species. One such group of synthetic organic pesticides widely used worldwide to combat pathogenic fungi affecting plants is the strobilurin chemical group. Whereas they are designed to control fungal pathogens, their general modes of action are not specific to fungi. Consequently, they can be potentially toxic to a wide range of non-target organisms. The present work had the intent to conduct an extensive literature review to find relevant research on the occurrence, fate and effects of azoxystrobin, the first patent of the strobilurin compounds, in aquatic ecosystems in order to identify strengths and gaps in the scientific database. Analytical procedures and existing legislation and regulations were also assessed. Data gathered in the present review revealed that analytical reference standards for the most relevant environmental metabolites of azoxystrobin are needed. Validated confirmatory methods for complex matrices, like sediment and aquatic organisms' tissues, are very limited. Important knowledge of base-line values of azoxystrobin and its metabolites in natural tropical and estuarine/marine ecosystems is lacking. Moreover, some environmental concentrations of azoxystrobin found in the present review are above the Regulatory Acceptable Concentration (RAC) in what concerns risk to aquatic invertebrates and the No Observed Ecologically Adverse Effect Concentration (NOEAEC) reported for freshwater communities. The present review also showed that there are very few data on azoxystrobin toxicity to different aquatic organisms, especially in what concerns estuarine/marine organisms. Besides, toxicity studies mostly address azoxystrobin and usually neglect the more relevant environmental metabolites. Further work is also required in what concerns effects of exposure to multi-stressors, e.g. pesticide mixtures. Even though Log Kow for azoxystrobin and R234886, the main metabolite of azoxystrobin in water, are below 3, the bio-concentration factor and the bioaccumulation potential for azoxystrobin are absent in the literature. Moreover, no single study on bioaccumulation and biomagnification processes was found in the present review.},

abstract = {Losses of corals worldwide emphasize the need to understand what drives reef decline. Stressors such as overfishing and nutrient pollution may reduce resilience of coral reefs by increasing coral–algal competition and reducing coral recruitment, growth and survivorship. Such effects may themselves develop via several mechanisms, including disruption of coral microbiomes. Here we report the results of a 3-year field experiment simulating overfishing and nutrient pollution. These stressors increase turf and macroalgal cover, destabilizing microbiomes, elevating putative pathogen loads, increasing disease more than twofold and increasing mortality up to eightfold. Above-average temperatures exacerbate these effects, further disrupting microbiomes of unhealthy corals and concentrating 80{\%} of mortality in the warmest seasons. Surprisingly, nutrients also increase bacterial opportunism and mortality in corals bitten by parrotfish, turning normal trophic interactions deadly for corals. Thus, overfishing and nutrient pollution impact reefs down to microbial scales, killing corals by sensitizing them to predation, above-average temperatures and bacterial opportunism.},

abstract = {Nickel has long been known to be an important human toxicant, including having the ability to form carcinomas, but until recently nickel was believed to be an issue only to microorganisms living in nickel-rich serpentine soils or areas contaminated by industrial pollution. This assumption was overturned by the discovery of a nickel defense system (RcnR/RcnA) found in microorganisms that live in a wide range of environmental niches, suggesting that nickel homeostasis is a general biological concern. To date, the mechanisms of nickel toxicity in microorganisms and higher eukaryotes are poorly understood. In this review, we summarize nickel homeostasis processes used by microorganisms and highlight in vivo and in vitro effects of exposure to elevated concentrations of nickel. On the basis of this evidence we propose four mechanisms of nickel toxicity: (1) nickel replaces the essential metal of metalloproteins, (2) nickel binds to catalytic residues of non-metalloenzymes; (3) nickel binds outside the catalytic site of an enzyme to inhibit allosterically and (4) nickel indirectly causes oxidative stress.},

In some investigations carried out in Austria, Brazil, Canada, Croatia, England, Germany, Greece, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, The Netherlands, and the U.S., more than 80 compounds, pharmaceuticals and several drug metabolites, have been detected in the aquatic environment. Several PhACs from various prescription classes have been found at concentrations up to the microg/l-level in sewage influent and effluent samples and also in several surface waters located downstream from municipal sewage treatment plants (STPs). The studies show that some PhACs originating from human therapy are not eliminated completely in the municipal STPs and are, thus, discharged as contaminants into the receiving waters. Under recharge conditions, polar PhACs such as clofibric acid, carbamazepine, primidone or iodinated contrast agents can leach through the subsoil and have also been detected in several groundwater samples in Germany. Positive findings of PhACs have, however, also been reported in groundwater contaminated by landfill leachates or manufacturing residues.

abstract = {The preferential synthesis of heat shock proteins (Hsps) in response to thermal stress [the heat shock response (HSR)] has been shown to vary in species that occupy different thermal environments. A survey of case studies of aquatic (mostly marine) organisms occupying stable thermal environments at all latitudes, from polar to tropical, shows that they do not in general respond to heat stress with an inducible HSR. Organisms that occupy highly variable thermal environments (variations up to {\textgreater}20 degrees C), like the intertidal zone, induce the HSR frequently and within the range of body temperatures they normally experience, suggesting that the response is part of their biochemical strategy to occupy this thermal niche. The highest temperatures at which these organisms can synthesize Hsps are only a few degrees Celsius higher than the highest body temperatures they experience. Thus, they live close to their thermal limits and any further increase in temperature is probably going to push them beyond those limits. In comparison, organisms occupying moderately variable thermal environments ({\textless}10 degrees C), like the subtidal zone, activate the HSR at temperatures above those they normally experience in their habitats. They have a wider temperature range above their body temperature range over which they can synthesize Hsps. Contrary to our expectations, species from highly (in comparison with moderately) variable thermal environments have a limited acclimatory plasticity. Due to this variation in the HSR, species from stable and highly variable environments are likely to be more affected by climate change than species from moderately variable environments.},

abstract = {The fate of antibiotics in the environment, and especially antibiotics used in animal husbandry, is subject to recent studies and the issue of this review. The assumed quantity of antibiotics excreted by animal husbandry adds up to thousands of tonnes per year. Administered medicines, their metabolites or degradation products reach the terrestrial and aquatic environment by the application of manure or slurry to areas used agriculturally, or by pasture-reared animals excreting directly on the land, followed by surface run-off, driftage or leaching in deeper layers of the earth. The scientific interest in antimicrobially active compounds in manure and soil, but also in surface and ground water, has increased during the last decade. On the one side, scientific interest has focused on the behaviour of antibiotics and their fate in the environment, on the other hand, their impact on environmental and other bacteria has become an issue of research. Analytical methods have now been developed appropriately and studies using these new techniques provide accurate data on concentrations of antimicrobial compounds and their residues in different organic matters. Some antibiotics seem to persist a long time in the environment, especially in soil, while others degrade very fast. Not only the fate of these pharmaceuticals but their origin as well is an object of scientific interest. Besides human input via wastewater and other effluents, livestock production has been recognised as a source of contamination. One main concern with regard to the excessive use of antibiotics in livestock production is the potential promotion of resistance and the resulting disadvantages in the therapeutic use of antimicrobials. Since the beginning of antibiotic therapy, more and more resistant bacterial strains have been isolated from environmental sources showing one or multiple resistance. There have been several attempts to use antibiotic resistance patterns in different bacteria as indicators for various sources of faecal pollution. This review gives an overview of the available data on the present use of veterinary antibiotics in agriculture, on the occurrence of antibiotic compounds and resistant bacteria in soil and water and demonstrates the need for further studies. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, standard acute toxicity tests were conducted using the microbe Vibrio fischeri, freshwater macroinvertebrates Daphnia magna and Moina macrocopa, and fish (Oryzias latipes) for these antibiotics. Antibiotics were more frequently detected at higher amounts in effluent samples and in samples collected during the low-flow season. For trimethoprim and chloramphenicol, the levels observed in surface water during low flow were, on average, 108 and 31 ng/L, respectively. These levels were comparable to those measured in the municipal effluents (average, 80 and 37 ng/L, respectively), suggesting the presence of other sources upstream (e.g., livestock wastes). For roxithromycin, surface water levels were approximately an order of magnitude lower than effluent levels. Adverse effects of roxithromycin, trimethoprim, and chloramphenicol were observed at mg/L levels in standard acute aquatic ecotoxicity tests. Based on hazard quotients calculated for the three antibiotics, minimal risks to aquatic systems are suggested. To further increase scientific understanding about the potential impacts of these pharmaceuticals in the environment, however, chronic ecotoxicology studies, with more subtle but ecologically meaningful end points or in combination with other mechanistically related contaminants, may be beneficial.},

In a series of microcosm experiments I empirically derived the functional response curves for two common types of stream predators, sculpins (Cottus bairdi) and stonefly larvae (Agnetina capitata), on two behaviorally and morphologically distinct types of mayfly prey (Baetis tricaudatus and Ephemerella subvaria). Data from these separate trials were combined using simple additive models to generate predicted combined functional responses for both types of predator. For both types of prey, actual combined functional response curves (both types of predators together in a treatment) differed significantly from predicted combined functional response for some ranges of prey densities. When Baetis was used as prey, significant departures from the predicted values occurred at moderate and high prey densities and were in a negative direction (interference between predators). When Ephemerella was the prey, significant departures occurred at low and moderate densities and were in a positive direction (facilitation between predators). Additive models for predicting combined predator effects cannot account for non-linearities in combined functional response introduced by non-trophic (behavioral) interactions that occur between fish and stoneflies, and between these predators and their prey. Other aquatic and terrestrial food webs contain similar linkages between vertebrate and invertebrate predators and their prey. Inclusion of behavioral interaction terms seems likely to be a necessary part of any general predicting combined effects of predators on prey populations in these systems.},

abstract = {The microbial contribution to ecological resilience is still largely overlooked in coral reef ecology. Coral-associated bacteria serve a wide variety of functional roles with reference to the coral host, and thus, the composition of the overall microbiome community can strongly influence coral health and survival. Here, we synthesize the findings of recent studies (n=45) that evaluated the impacts of the top three stressors facing coral reefs, climate change, water pollution and overfishing, on coral microbiome community structure and diversity. Contrary to the species losses that are typical of many ecological communities under stress, here we show that microbial richness tends to be higher rather than lower for stressed corals (i.e. in {\~{}}60{\%} of cases), regardless of the stressor. Microbial responses to stress were taxonomically consistent across stressors, with specific taxa typically increasing in abundance (e.g. Vibrionales, Flavobacteriales, Rhodobacterales, Altermonadales, Rhizobiales, Rhodospirillales and Desulfovibrionales) and others declining (e.g. Oceanosprillales). Emerging evidence also suggests that stress may increase the microbial beta diversity amongst coral colonies, potentially reflecting a reduced ability of the coral host to regulate its microbiome. Moving forward, studies will need to discern the implications of stress-induced shifts in microbiome diversity for the coral hosts and may be able to use microbiome community structure to identify resilient corals. The evidence we present here supports the hypothesis that microbial communities play important roles in ecological resilience, and we encourage a focus on the microbial contributions to resilience for future research.},

Residues from human environments and from farms may contain antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes that can contaminate natural environments. The clearest consequence of antibiotic release in natural environments is the selection of resistant bacteria. The same resistance genes found at clinical settings are currently disseminated among pristine ecosystems without any record of antibiotic contamination. Nevertheless, the effect of antibiotics on the biosphere is wider than this and can impact the structure and activity of environmental microbiota.

abstract = {The degradation of two of the most frequently used UV-filters was investigated through microcosm studies. Marine sediments sampled from two sites in Italy (La Spezia harbour and Sarno river estuary, S1 and S2 respectively) were used to set up aerobic and anaerobic sets of reactors. The sediments were spiked with a methanol solution of 3-(4-methylbenzylidene)camphor (4-MBC) and 2-ethylhexyl 4-(dimethylamino)benzoate (EH-DPAB), at concentrations of either 25 or 50{\"{i}}¿½mg{\"{i}}¿½kg−{\"{i}}¿½1each. Methanol (6.3{\"{i}}¿½g/L) also served as an organic amendment and growth substrate for improving microbial activity. Monitoring of the biotic and abiotic degradation of the selected contaminants over 16{\"{i}}¿½months revealed that 4-MBC biodegradation was very slow and incomplete, whereas over 90{\%} of EH-DPAB was degraded both in the aerobic and the anaerobic reactors by the natural microbial communities of both sediments. Repeated spikes of EH-DPAB were followed by complete decay, characterised by first-order kinetics. The calculated kinetic rate constants under aerobic and anaerobic conditions were similar. In reactors inoculated with the S1 sediment the degradation rate constants progressively increased after each spike, up to the value of 0.039{\"{i}}¿½d−{\"{i}}¿½1. For the S2 sediment the rate constant was around 0.020{\"{i}}¿½d−{\"{i}}¿½1throughout the duration of the experiment. Mass spectrometry analysis of sediment extracts allowed detection of potential transformation products of EH-DPAB and 4-MBC. Moreover, the natural microbial community of the sediments was studied using the CAtalyzed Reporter Deposition Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (CARD-FISH) both in the initial sediments and after degradation under aerobic and anaerobic conditions.},

abstract = {Environmental effects on body size are of widespread ecological and economic importance but our understanding of these effects has been obscured by an apparent paradox. Life history analysis suggests that it is adaptive for adults to emerge smaller if reared in conditions that slow down juvenile growth. However, whereas smaller adults emerge if growth is limited by food availability, the reverse is usually observed if growth is limited by temperature. The resolution of this apparent paradox may be that the response of adult size to temperature is adaptive, but is constrained by a trade-off that can be understood in terms of von Bertalanffy's classic theory of growth. Alternatively, the response may be the unavoidable consequence of a fundamental relationship between cell size and temperature.},

abstract = {Pharmaceutically-active compounds are regularly and widely released into the aquatic environment in an unaltered form or as metabolites. So far, little is known about their potential detrimental effects on algae populations which can ultimately impact nutrient cycling and oxygen balance. For our analysis, the common microalga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (P. subcapitata) was exposed to a mixture of 13 drugs found in Italian wastewaters and rivers. Traces of pharmaceuticals investigated were detected in treated algal cells, except for cyclophosphamide and ranitidine, indicating that these algae are able to absorb pharmaceutical pollutants from the environment. The effects of the treatment were investigated by Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism (AFLP) assessment of DNA damage and 2-DE proteomic analysis. While no genotoxic effect was detected, proteomic analysis showed that algae are sensitive to the presence of drugs and that, in particular, the chloroplast is affected. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.Many microbial ecology studies have demonstrated profound changes in community composition caused by environmental pollution, as well as adaptation processes allowing survival of microbes in polluted ecosystems. Soil microbial communities in polluted areas with a long-term history of contamination have been shown to maintain their function by developing metal-tolerance mechanisms. In the present work, we review recent experiments, with specific emphasis on studies that have been conducted in polluted areas with a long-term history of contamination that also applied DNA-based approaches. We evaluate how the “costs” of adaptation to metals affect the responses of metal-tolerant communities to other stress factors (“stress-on-stress”). We discuss recent studies on the stability of microbial communities, in terms of resistance and resilience to additional stressors, focusing on metal pollution as the initial stress, and discuss possible factors influencing the functional and structural stability of microbial communities towards secondary stressors. There is increasing evidence that the history of environmental conditions and disturbance regimes play central roles in responses of microbial communities towards secondary stressors.},

Bioassays were performed on bacteria, algae, microcrustaceans, and fishes in order to calculate their predicted no-effect concentrations (PNEC) and to perform a first approach of risk characterization. For this aim, risk has been estimated by the predicted environmental concentration/PNEC ratio and the measured environmental concentration/PNEC ratio. First, regarding the PNEC, carbamazepine appears to be the more hazardous compound. Second, even though it is demonstrated that carbamazepine, clofibric acid, and diclofenac have been detected in effluents, only carbamazepine have been detected in all sewage treatment plants with the greatest concentrations. Third, risk quotients greater than unity were calculated only for carbamazepine, suggesting that risk for the water compartment is expected.},

abstract = {Interactions among drugs play a critical role in the killing efficacy of multi-drug treatments. Recent advances in theory and experiment for three-drug interactions enable the search for emergent interactions-ones not predictable from pairwise interactions. Previous work has shown it is easier to detect synergies and antagonisms among pairwise interactions when a rescaling method is applied to the interaction metric. However, no study has carefully examined whether new types of normalization might be needed for emergence. Here, we propose several rescaling methods for enhancing the classification of the higher order drug interactions based on our conceptual framework. To choose the rescaling that best separates synergism, antagonism and additivity, we conducted bacterial growth experiments in the presence of single, pairwise and triple-drug combinations among 14 antibiotics. We found one of our rescaling methods is far better at distinguishing synergistic and antagonistic emergent interactions than any of the other methods. Using our new method, we find around 50{\%} of emergent interactions are additive, much less than previous reports of greater than 90{\%} additivity. We conclude that higher order emergent interactions are much more common than previously believed, and we argue these findings for drugs suggest that appropriate rescaling is crucial to infer higher order interactions.},

abstract = {To understand the further impacts of multiple stressors in freshwater, we investigated the effects of heavy metal (HM, Cu and Zn) and nutrient enrichments (nitrogen and phosphorus, NP) on microbial decomposition of Pterocarya stenoptera litter and the associated extracellular enzyme activities and microbial biomass with microcosms. Results showed that the decomposition rates were slower in the polluted stream waters than those in the unpolluted ones, which corresponded to lower microbial biomass and integrated enzyme activities of cellulose and $\beta$-glucosidase. The decomposition rates were accelerated at low HM level, which was associated with the stimulated enzyme activities of hydrolytic enzymes or was stimulated by both NP levels in polluted stream waters. In particular, the hydrolase enzyme activities of microbial communities in polluted stream waters were stimulated by low HM level, suggesting that low HM level-stimulated litter decomposition may be due to the increased enzymatic activities. When microbial communities were exposed to HM and NP simultaneously, the inhibitory effect (in unpolluted stream waters) or the stimulated effect (in polluted stream waters) of low HM concentration was enhanced and attenuated, respectively, which suggests that the NP antagonistic effect against HM toxicity on litter decomposition may contribute to the litter-associated extracellular enzyme activities. These results suggest that the co-occurrence of HM and NP may have antagonistic effects on stream ecosystem functioning. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Research Centre for Eco-Environmental Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences.},

Nevertheless, extensive studies of higher-order (more than two component) interactions have been lacking. Here, we conduct experiments using 20 three-drug combinations and their effects on the bacterial growth of Escherichia coli We report our measurements of growth rates in single, pairwise and triple-drug combinations. To uncover emergent interactions, we derive a simple framework to calculate expectations for three-way interactions based on the measured impact of each individual stressor and of each pairwise interaction. Using our framework, we find that (i) emergent antagonisms are more common than emergent synergies and (ii) emergent antagonisms are more common and emergent synergies are more rare than would be inferred from measures of net effects that do not disentangle pairwise interactions from three-way interactions.},

The results indicated that SOD, CAT, GST and T-AOC were induced upon exposure to atrazine. The growth of two bacteria was better in the absence than in the presence of atrazine, indicating that atrazine can decrease bacterial growth. The changes of enzyme activities indicate the presence of oxidative stress.

Based on numerous studies since 2007, this critical review aims to give an overview on the mechanisms, developments and applications of LBTA. Firstly, based on the introduction of the mechanisms of LBTA, this review shows the interferences from the characteristics of testing samples (such as inorganic nutrients, color, turbidity) and summarizes the improvements on pretreatment method, test methods and test systems in recent years. Regarding the factors that affect the toxicity prediction of single chemicals, the correlation between the toxicity index expressed as median effective concentration (EC50) and characters (such as Kow, the alkyl chain length, the anion and the cation) of known chemicals, especially the emerging ionic liquids (ILs), were given an in-depth discussion. The models for predicting the joint effect of mixtures to luminescent bacteria were also presented. For the factors that affect the toxicity of actual waters, the correlation of toxicity of actual samples to luminescent bacteria and their conventional indexes were discussed. Comparing the sensitivity of the LBTA with other bioassays could indicate the feasibility of the LBTA applied on specific samples. The summary on the application of LBTA to environmental samples has been made to find the future research direction. {\textcopyright} 2013.},

Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

abstract = {Ecotoxicological effect studies often expose test organisms under optimal environmental conditions. However, organisms in their natural settings rarely experience optimal conditions. On the contrary, during most of their lifetime they are forced to cope with sub-optimal conditions and occasionally with severe environmental stress. Interactions between the effects of a natural stressor and a toxicant can sometimes result in greater effects than expected from either of the stress types alone. The aim of the present review is to provide a synthesis of existing knowledge on the interactions between effects of "natural" and chemical (anthropogenic) stressors. More than 150 studies were evaluated covering stressors including heat, cold, desiccation, oxygen depletion, pathogens and immunomodulatory factors combined with a variety of environmental pollutants. This evaluation revealed that synergistic interactions between the effects of various natural stressors and toxicants are not uncommon phenomena. Thus, synergistic interactions were reported in more than 50{\%} of the available studies on these interactions. Antagonistic interactions were also detected, but in fewer cases. Interestingly, about 70{\%} of the tested chemicals were found to compromise the immune system of humans as judged from studies on human cell lines. The challenge for future studies will therefore be to include aspects of combined stressors in effect and risk assessment of chemicals in the environment. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Aldolases are a specific group of lyases that catalyze the reversible stereoselective addition of a donor compound (nucleophile) onto an acceptor compound (electrophile). Whereas most aldolases are specific for their donor compound in the aldolization reaction, they often tolerate a wide range of aldehydes as acceptor compounds. C-C bonding by aldolases creates stereocenters in the resulting aldol products. This makes aldolases interesting tools for asymmetric syntheses of rare sugars or sugar-derived compounds as iminocyclitols, statins, epothilones, and sialic acids. Besides the well-known fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase, other aldolases of microbial origin have attracted the interest of synthetic bio-organic chemists in recent years. These are either other dihydroxyacetone phosphate aldolases or aldolases depending on pyruvate/phosphoenolpyruvate, glycine, or acetaldehyde as donor substrate. Recently, an aldolase that accepts dihydroxyacetone or hydroxyacetone as a donor was described. A further enlargement of the arsenal of available chemoenzymatic tools can be achieved through screening for novel aldolase activities and directed evolution of existing aldolases to alter their substrate- or stereospecifities. We give an update of work on aldolases, with an emphasis on microbial aldolases.},

abstract = {Pharmaceuticals are continuously discharged into the environment, resulting in the chronic exposure of aquatic organisms to these compounds. In this multigenerational study, we examined the influence of four pharmaceuticals (carbamazepine (CBZ), diclofenac (DIC), 17??-ethinylestradiol (EE2) and metoprolol (MET)) as single substances and as a drug mixture at environmentally relevant concentrations on life-history and morphological parameters over six generations of the cladoceran Daphnia magna. Detectable effects of the used pharmaceuticals occured in the first observed generation, followed by an acclimation period and a recurrence of drug effects in later generations: daphnids exposed to MET were affected by the pharmaceutical, resulting in a decreased body length at first reproduction in the generations F0, F3 and F4 and in a reduced number of offspring in the generations F0 and F4. Similar effects were observed in daphnids exposed to EE2. DIC delayed age at first reproduction in the F0 and F2 generations and increased the body length of neonates in the generations F1 and F5. Daphnids exposed to CBZ showed a delay in the age at first reproduction for the F0 generation only. The drug mixture reduced the age at first reproduction of daphnids in the F0 and F2 generation and increased the body length at first reproduction in the generations F0 and F3. Neither the single drugs nor the pharmaceutical mixture influenced the successive generations of D. magna in a steady way. Thus, multigenerational studies are necessary to prevent insufficient assessments on the impact of pharmaceuticals in aquatic ecosystems. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

These stressors often co-occur and interact in different ways which are not yet fully understood. Here, we applied a population model representing a freshwater amphipod feeding on leaf litter in forested streams. We simulated impacts of hypothetical stressors, individually and in pairwise combinations that target the individuals' feeding, maintenance, growth and reproduction. Impacts were quantified by examining responses at three levels of biological organisation: individual-level body sizes and cumulative reproduction, population-level abundance and biomass and ecosystem-level leaf litter decomposition. Interactive effects of multiple stressors at the individual level were mostly antagonistic, that is, less negative than expected. Most population- and ecosystem-level responses to multiple stressors were stronger than expected from an additive model, that is, synergistic. Our results suggest that across levels of biological organisation responses to multiple stressors are rarely only additive. We suggest methods for efficiently quantifying impacts of multiple stressors at different levels of biological organisation.},

abstract = {Ecological stressors (i.e. environmental factors outside their normal range of variation) can mediate each other through their interactions, leading to unexpected combined effects on communities. Determining whether the net effect of stressors is ecologically surprising requires comparing their cumulative impact to a null model that represents the linear combination of their individual effects (i.e. an additive expectation). However, we show that standard additive and multiplicative null models that base their predictions on the effects of single stressors on community properties (e.g. species richness or biomass) do not provide this linear expectation, leading to incorrect interpretations of antagonistic and synergistic responses by communities. We present an alternative, the compositional null model, which instead bases its predictions on the effects of stressors on individual species, and then aggregates them to the community level. Simulations demonstrate the improved ability of the compositional null model to accurately provide a linear expectation of the net effect of stressors. We simulate the response of communities to paired stressors that affect species in a purely additive fashion and compare the relative abilities of the compositional null model and two standard community property null models (additive and multiplicative) to predict these linear changes in species richness and community biomass across different combinations (both positive, negative, or opposite) and intensities of stressors. The compositional model predicts the linear effects of multiple stressors under almost all scenarios, allowing for proper classification of net effects, whereas the standard null models do not. Our findings suggest that current estimates of the prevalence of ecological surprises on communities based on community property null models are unreliable, and should be improved by integrating the responses of individual species to the community level as does our compositional null model.

abstract = {In the 20 years since risk assessment was codified it has been applied to the management of ecological systems, first tentatively with one chemical and one receptor, to its current application at large spatial and temporal scales. The original risk assessment paradigm in the National Research Council's report {\textless}i{\textgreater}Risk Assessment in the Federal Government: Managing the Process{\textless}/i{\textgreater}, known as the {\&}ldquo;Red Book,{\&}rdquo; was modified by the risk assessment group at Oak Ridge National Laboratory so that it could be applied to ecological systems. Even in the early 1990s, it was apparent that to be ultimately successful as a management tool, risk assessment had to be applied to populations, communities, and eventually to the ecological landscape at large scales. The risk analysis of multiple stressors, not just multiple chemicals but multiple types of agents, was also seen as a major challenge. During the late part of the 1990s and early 2000s, attempts were made to conduct risk assessments at the watershed and other comparable landscape levels. Studies on the fjord of Port Valdez, Alaska; the Clinch River in Tennessee, the Big Darby in Ohio, and Codorus Creek in Pennsylvania have attempted such risk assessments. Currently it appears possible to conduct landscape scale risk assessments, although the development of appropriate spatial statistical and uncertainty analysis methods is necessary. The future ecological risk assessment is broadening to include not only chemicals but also a wide variety of environmental stressors. These stressors include urbanization, changes in land use, fishing, and climate change. The structure of ecological risk assessment also provides a common framework allowing the multiple stakeholders, regulatory groups, and scientists to come to terms with the inherent difficulties of managing complex systems. Risk assessment has the potential of becoming the generalized quantitative tool of environmental management and decision-making at multiple scales.},

abstract = {The metal ions carcinogenic to humans are As, Be, Cd, Cr and Ni, and the candidates also include Co, Cu, Fe and Pt. A range of molecular mechanisms was proposed for these metals, reflecting their diverse chemical properties. The oxidative concept in metal carcinogenesis proposes that some complexes of the above metals (Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ni) formed in vivo undergo redox cycling, yielding reactive oxygen species and/or high valence metal ions which oxidize DNA. Some of the products of oxidative DNA damage, including 8-oxoguanine and strand breaks, induce mutations, which may lead to neoplastic transformation. The establishment of metal-binding modes in the cell nucleus and of their reactivity is crucial for the understanding of molecular events in metal carcinogenesis. We have proposed the binding sites for Ni(II) and Cu(II) in core histones (H3, H2A) and sperm protamines (HP2) and, using molecular models, provided evidence for the generation of promutagenic oxidative DNA damage by the bound metals. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Moreover, there is a lack of research for by-products (metabolites and transformation products) characterization, occurrence and fate in all water types and especially in drinking water. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Exposure to pollution exerts strong selective pressure on microbial communities, which may affect their potential to adapt to current or future environmental challenges. In this microcosm study, we used DNA fingerprinting based on 16S rRNA genes to document the impact of high concentrations of benzene on two bacterial communities from a benzene-contaminated aquifer situated below a petrochemical plant (SIReN, UK). The two groundwaters harboured distinct aerobic benzene-degrading communities able to metabolize benzene to below detection levels (1 microg L(-1)). A benzene concentration of 100 mg L(-1) caused a major shift from Betaproteobacteria to Actinobacteria, in particular Arthrobacter spp. A similar shift from Betaproteobacteria to Arthrobacter spp. and Rhodococcus erythropolis was observed in minimal medium (MM) inoculated with a third groundwater. These Gram-positive-dominated communities were able to grow on benzene at concentrations up to 600 mg L(-1) in groundwater and up to 1000 mg L(-1) in MM, concentrations that cause significant solvent stress to cellular systems. Therefore, Gram-positive bacteria were better competitors than Gram-negative organisms under experimental conditions of high benzene loads, which suggests that solvent-tolerant Gram-positive bacteria can play a role in the natural attenuation of benzene or the remediation of contaminated sites.},

abstract = {—Microorganisms contribute significantly to primary production, nutrient cycling, and decomposition in estuarine eco-systems; therefore, detrimental effects of pesticides on microbial species may have subsequent impacts on higher trophic levels. Pesticides may affect estuarine microorganisms via spills, runoff, and drift. Both the structure and the function of microbial communities may be impaired by pesticide toxicity. Pesticides may also be metabolized or bioaccumulated by microorganisms. Mechanisms of toxicity vary, depending on the type of pesticide and the microbial species exposed. Herbicides are generally most toxic to phototrophic microorganisms, exhibiting toxicity by disrupting photosynthesis. Atrazine is the most widely used and most extensively studied herbicide. Toxic effects of organophosphate and organochlorine insecticides on microbial species have also been demonstrated, although their mechanisms of toxicity in such nontarget species remain unclear. There is a great deal of variability in the toxicity of even a single pesticide among microbial species. When attempting to predict the toxicity of pesticides in estuarine ecosystems, effects of pesticide mixtures and interactions with nutrients should be considered. The toxicity of pesticides to aquatic microorganisms, especially bacteria and protozoa, is an area of research requiring further study.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.Trade-offs may influence both physiological and evolutionary responses to co-occurring stressors, but their effects on both plastic and adaptive responses to climate change are poorly understood. To test for genetic and physiological trade-offs incurred in tolerating multiple stressors, we hybridized two populations of the intertidal copepod Tigriopus californicus that were divergent for both heat and salinity tolerance. Starting in the F2 generation, we selected for increased tolerance of heat, low salinity, and high salinity in replicate lines. After five generations of selection, heat-selected lines had greater heat tolerance but lower fecundity, indicating an energetic cost to tolerance. Lines selected for increased salinity tolerance did not show evidence of adaptation to their respective environments; however, hypo-osmotic selection lines showed substantial loss of tolerance to hyperosmotic stress. Neither of the salinity selection regimes resulted in diminished heat tolerance at ambient salinity; however, simultaneous exposure to heat and hypo-osmotic stress led to decreased heat tolerance, implying a physiological trade-off in tolerance to the two stressors. When we quantified the transcriptomic response to heat and salinity stress via RNA sequencing, we observed little overlap in the stress responses, suggesting the observed synergistic effects of heat and salinity stress were driven by competing energetic demands, rather than shared stress response pathways.},

abstract = {* Measures of organic matter processing have been proposed as indices of stream ecosystem function to complement structural measures (water quality, taxonomic composition) in stream health monitoring. However, to be meaningful for ecosystem management, functional responses must be informed by knowledge of multiple stressors in the face of global change. * We manipulated nutrient concentrations (two levels), fine sediment (two levels) and water temperature (eight levels, 0–6 °C above ambient) in 128 streamside mesocosms to determine the individual and combined effects of these stressors on decomposition rates of fresh and pre-dried leaf packs and cotton strips. * Raised temperature affected all seven studied decomposition measures. Leaf biomass loss rates were linearly positively affected, while strength loss rates of leaves and cotton strips showed nonlinear, weakly unimodal responses. Respiration of fresh leaves was positively affected by warming, but respiration of dried leaves showed the opposite pattern. Nutrient enrichment enhanced dried leaf biomass loss and respiration, and cotton tensile strength loss. Sediment addition increased loss of fresh leaf strength and biomass, but decreased dried leaf respiration. * Interactions among stressors occurred in three cases. The positive effect of raised temperature on biomass loss of dried leaves was weaker in mesocosms with added sediment, the negative effect of sediment on dried leaf respiration annulled the positive effect of nutrients, and cotton strength loss increased strongly under enriched nutrients but less so when sediment was added. * Synthesis and applications. Sediment greatly increased decay rates of fresh (living) leaves, but not of dried leaves or cotton strips. Leaf condition can strongly affect decomposition processes, with important consequences for streams that naturally receive freshly fallen leaves and have high sediment loads. Nonlinear responses of decomposition to rising temperature highlight how a warming climate may alter organic matter processing in complex ways. Our finding that dried leaf biomass loss responded positively to nutrient enrichment but not sediment addition, while fresh leaf biomass loss responded positively to sediment addition but not nutrient enrichment, suggests the two measures may offer complementary information in the functional assessment of multiple stressors in streams.},

abstract = {The widespread detection of antibiotics in terrestrial and aquatic systems has engendered significant scientific and regulatory concern. Overall, knowledge concerning the ecotoxicology and sub-lethal effects in water is scarce, but some experimental studies show that antibiotics can induce pathogen resistance and they can also have detrimental effects on natural microbial communities and their key functions. The main aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of the biodegradation and photodegradation processes of the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin (CIP) in the River Tiber waters, in a stretch highly impacted from human pressure. Two set of microcosms consisting of river water containing the natural microbial community and treated with 500 $\mu$g/L of CIP in absence or presence of UV-light were performed. Moreover, some microcosms were filled with river water previously sterilized and then treated with the antibiotic. The combined experimental set made it possible to evaluate if the antibiotic CIP could be photodegraded and/or biodegraded. CIP residual concentrations were measured over time by using HPLC coupled to fluorescence detection (FLD) and the effects of the antibiotic on the natural microbial community were assessed in terms of live cell abundance. The key role of light in CIP disappearance was confirmed, but also its biodegradation in natural river water was demonstrated. In fact, differently from other experiments we found a higher degradation rate (DT50= 10.4 d), in presence of both light and the natural river bacterial populations than in the same sterilized river water (DT50= 18.4 d). Moreover, even in the dark, a partial CIP biodegradation was also observed (DT50= 177 d). The overall results were supported by the increase in live cell numbers with the decrease of CIP concentrations both in the dark and light condition.},

abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

It requires data of mixture effect at least one exposure concentration of the mixture in which fractions of all components and concentration-response functions for each component are known. The GCA model evaluates interaction between components by introducing a novel response function, which is independent of the response functions for each individual components, in order to describe the effect of addition between different components. We applied the GCA method to published mixture toxicity data and found it to fit the mixture effect better than both the concentration addition model and the independent action model, the implication being that the proposed approach is widely applicable},

We hypothesize that resistance to additional stressors depends increasingly on species tolerances being positively correlated (i.e. positive species co- tolerance). Initial exposure to a stressor combined with positive species co-tolerance should reduce the impacts of other stressors, which we term stress-induced community tolerance. In contrast, negative species co-tolerance is expected to result in additional stressors having pronounced additive or synergistic impacts on biologically impoverished functional groups, which we term stress-induced community sensitivity. Therefore, the sign and strength of the correlation between species sensitivities to multiple stressors must be considered when predicting the impacts of global change on ecosystem functioning as mediated by changes in biodiversity.},

abstract = {Organism size is one of the key determinants of community structure, and its relationship with abundance can describe how biomass is partitioned among the biota within an ecosystem. An outdoor freshwater mesocosm experiment was used to determine how warming of ?4 1C would affect the size, biomass and taxonomic structure of planktonic communities. Warming increased the steepness of the community size spectrum by increasing the prevalence of small organisms, primarily within the phytoplankton assemblage and it also reduced the mean and maximum size of phytoplankton by approximately one order of magnitude. The observed shifts in phytoplankton size structure were reflected in changes in phytoplankton community composition, though zooplankton taxonomic composition was unaffected by warming. Furthermore, warming reduced community biomass and total phytoplank- ton biomass, although zooplankton biomass was unaffected. This resulted in an increase in the zooplankton to phytoplankton biomass ratio in the warmed mesocosms, which could be explained by faster turnover within the phytoplankton assemblages. Overall, warming shifted the distribution of phytoplankton size towards smaller individuals with rapid turnover and low standing biomass, resulting in a reorganization of the biomass structure of the food webs. These results indicate future environmental warming may have profound effects on the structure and functioning of aquatic communities and ecosystems.},

In this study, mutants of Escherichia coli that lack copper homeostatic systems (copA cueO cus) were used to identify intracellular targets and to test the hypothesis that toxicity involves the action of reactive oxygen species. Low micromolar levels of copper were sufficient to inhibit the growth of both WT and mutant strains. The addition of branched-chain amino acids restored growth, indicating that copper blocks their biosynthesis. Indeed, copper treatment rapidly inactivated isopropylmalate dehydratase, an iron-sulfur cluster enzyme in this pathway. Other enzymes in this iron-sulfur dehydratase family were similarly affected. Inactivation did not require oxygen, in vivo or with purified enzyme. Damage occurred concomitant with the displacement of iron atoms from the solvent-exposed cluster, suggesting that Cu(I) damages these proteins by liganding to the coordinating sulfur atoms. Copper efflux by dedicated export systems, chelation by glutathione, and cluster repair by assembly systems all enhance the resistance of cells to this metal.},

abstract = {Low levels of pharmaceuticals are detected in surface, ground, and drinking water worldwide. Usage and incorrect disposal have been considered the major environmental sources of these microcontaminants. Recent publications, however, suggest that wastewater from drug production can potentially be a source of much higher concentrations in certain locations. The present study investigated the environmental fate of active pharmaceutical ingredients in a major production area for the global bulk drug market. Water samples were taken from a common effluent treatment plant near Hyderabad, India, which receives process water from approximately 90 bulk drug manufacturers. Surface water was analyzed from the recipient stream and from two lakes that are not contaminated by the treatment plant. Water samples were also taken from wells in six nearby villages. The samples were analyzed for the presence of 12 pharmaceuticals with liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry. All wells were determined to be contaminated with drugs. Ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, cetirizine, terbinafine, and citalopram were detected at more than 1 mg/L in several wells. Very high concentrations of ciprofloxacin (14 mg/L) and cetirizine (2.1 mg/L) were found in the effluent of the treatment plant, together with high concentrations of seven additional pharmaceuticals. Very high concentrations of ciprofloxacin (up to 6.5 mg/L), cetirizine (up to 1.2 mg/L), norfloxacin (up to 0.52 mg/L), and enoxacin (up to 0.16 mg/L) were also detected in the two lakes, which clearly shows that the investigated area has additional environmental sources of insufficiently treated industrial waste. Thus, insufficient wastewater management in one of the world's largest centers for bulk drug production leads to unprecedented drug contamination of surface, ground, and drinking water. This raises serious concerns regarding the development of antibiotic resistance, and it creates a major challenge for producers and regulatory agencies to improve the situation.},

abstract = {Climate change is an ongoing and imminent phenomenon and currently threatens, to various degrees, all habitations across the world. Habitations comprise of built environments that have traditionally evolved in adaptive response to the prevalent natural environment characterized by climate, local resources, ecosystem services, and the evolving culture and lifestyles of people. However, in the present scenario, buildings are responsible for more than 50{\%} of the global usage of resources and energy and the consequent emissions. Further, climate change is manifesting at a much rapid pace than expected and its implication on buildings is unclear. The adaptation to climate change is now an additional functional requirement expected from a building. The specific response would vary according to the type of the building, climatic zone, demand on resources and energy placed by the building, prevalent lifestyle and physiological resilience of the occupants, and the vulnerability to climate change. While vulnerability is impending, its intensity and specific manifestation is unclear; it is pronounced in tropical regions characterized by dense human population and mostly in progressive countries with high occurrences of famine and poverty. These are regions with a larger share of vernacular (rural) dwellings and an increasing share of high-technology urban dwellings. The current article presents an overview of the role of adaptation of buildings in the context of climate change, the consequent implications on buildings in various climatic zones, and the possible strategies that need to be evaluated. Climate change adaptation in buildings is shortly expected to be a domain of specialized research requiring utmost attention and intellectual resources for action.},

abstract = {Metaldehyde is a common molluscicide, used to control slugs in agriculture and horticulture. It is resistant to breakdown by current water treatment processes, and its accumulation in drinking water sources leads to regular regulatory failures in drinking water quality. To address this problem, we isolated metaldehyde-degrading microbes from domestic soils. Two distinct bacterial isolates were cultured, that were able to grow prototrophically using metaldehyde as sole carbon and energy source. One isolate belonged to the genus Acinetobacter (strain designation E1) and the other isolate belonged to the genus Variovorax (strain designation E3). Acinetobacter E1 was able to degrade metaldehyde to a residual concentration {\textless} 1 nM, whereas closely related Acinetobacter strains were completely unable to degrade metaldehyde. Variovorax E3 grew and degraded metaldehyde more slowly than Acinetobacter E1, and residual metaldehyde remained at the end of growth of the Variovorax E3 strain. Biological degradation of metaldehyde using these bacterial strains or approaches that allow in situ amplification of metaldehyde-degrading bacteria may represent a way forward for dealing with metaldehyde contamination in soils and water.},

abstract = {Fresh water scarcity has led to increased use of reclaimed wastewater as an alternative and reliable source for crop irrigation. Beyond microbiological safety, concerns have been raised regarding contamination of reclaimed wastewater by xenobiotics including pharmaceuticals. This study focuses on carbamazepine, an anticonvulsant drug which is ubiquitously detected in reclaimed wastewater, highly persistent in soil, and taken up by crops. In a randomized controlled trial we demonstrate that healthy individuals consuming reclaimed wastewater-irrigated produce excreted carbamazepine and its metabolites in their urine, while subjects consuming fresh water-irrigated produce excreted undetectable or significantly lower levels of carbamazepine. We also report that the carbamazepine metabolite pattern at this low exposure level differed from that observed at therapeutic doses. This " proof of concept " study demonstrates that human exposure to xenobiotics occurs through ingestion of reclaimed wastewater-irrigated produce, providing real world data which could guide risk assessments and policy designed to ensure the safe use of wastewater for crop irrigation. ■ INTRODUCTION As a result of population pressure, urbanization, climate change, and rising demand for food, fresh water for agricultural purposes has become an increasingly scarce resource. Thus, arid and semiarid regions across the globe have become progressively dependent on reclaimed wastewater for crop irrigation. 1−3 For example, reclaimed wastewater makes up 50{\%} of the total irrigation-water used in Israel, 17{\%} in Spain and only 6{\%} in California. Recently, California has announced aims to increase reclaimed wastewater use for crop irrigation due to a prolonged drought. 4 Beyond water conservation, irrigation with reclaimed wastewater provides organic matter and nutrients to the agro-environment. However, safety concerns regarding the use of reclaimed wastewater for crop irrigation have also been raised. 1,3 Historically the focus of safety guidelines has been on transmission of wastewater-derived pathogens. More recently the contamination of ecosystems and arable land with organic pollutants such as endocrine-disrupting compounds, active pharmaceutical compounds and other synthetic compounds, and their eventual penetration to the food chain, have become emerging environmental and human health concerns.},

abstract = {Soil is a complex and dynamic biological system, and still in 2003 it is difficult to determine the composition of microbial communities in soil. We are also limited in the determination of microbially mediated reactions because present assays for determining the overall rate of entire metabolic processes (such as respiration) or specific enzyme activities (such as urease, protease and phosphomonoesterase activity) do not allow any identification of the microbial species directly involved in the measured processes. The central problem posed by the link between microbial diversity and soil function is to understand the relations between genetic diversity and community structure and between community structure and function. A better understanding of the relations between microbial diversity and soil functions requires not only the use of more accurate assays for taxonomically and functionally characterizing DNA and RNA extracted from soil, but also high-resolution techniques with which to detect inactive and active microbial cells in the soil matrix. Soil seems to be characterized by a redundancy of functions; for example, no relationship has been shown to exist between microbial diversity and decomposition of organic matter. Generally, a reduction in any group of species has little effect on overall processes in soil because other microorganisms can take on its function. The determination of the composition of microbial communities in soil is not necessary for a better quantification of nutrient transformations. The holistic approach, based on the division of the systems in pools and the measurement of fluxes linking these pools, is the most efficient. The determination of microbial C, N, P and S contents by fumigation techniques has allowed a better quantification of nutrient dynamics in soil. However, further advances require determining new pools, such as active microbial biomass, also with molecular techniques. Recently investigators have separated 13C- and 12C-DNA, both extracted from soil treated with a 13C source, by density-gradient centrifugation. This technique should allow us to calculate the active microbial C pool by multiplying the ratio between labelled and total DNA by the microbial biomass C content of soil. In addition, the taxonomic and functional characterization of 13C-DNA allows us to understand more precisely the changes in the composition of microbial communities affected by the C-substrate added to soil.

abstract = {The bioavailability of different metals has likely changed over the course of Earth's history. Based on geochemical models, copper became much more bioavailable with the advent of an oxidizing atmosphere. This posed both a challenge and an opportunity for the organisms at that time. Specifically, copper resistance mechanisms were required first and to do this Bacteria appear to have modified already existing protein structures. Later, Cu-utilizing proteins evolved and continue to be used sparingly, at least relative to later evolving Eukarya, by Bacteria but with significant biogeochemical consequences. Copper is a strong soft metal that can attack intracellular iron-sulfur centers of various proteins under primarily anoxic conditions. In oxic conditions, copper can catalyze a Fenton-like reaction that may cause lipid peroxidation and protein damage. The inherent ability of copper to inflict damage upon multiple cellular functions has been harnessed by macrophages and perhaps amoeba to kill and later digest bacteria and other microorganisms. Notably, these organisms, unlike Bacteria, most likely evolved after increases in copper availability, implying that Eukarya utilized their own trafficking and resistance mechanisms, in addition to the natural toxicity of copper, as leverage in interactions with Bacteria. In an "arms race," some pathogenic bacteria have evolved new mechanisms for copper resistance, which is relevant given renewed interest in the use of copper surfaces due to their antimicrobial properties.},

abstract = {Introduction: D-dimer assay, generally evaluated according to cutoff points calibrated for VTE exclusion, is used to estimate the individual risk of recurrence after a first idiopathic event of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Methods: Commercial D-dimer assays, evaluated according to predetermined cutoff levels for each assay, specific for age (lower in subjects {\textless}70 years) and gender (lower in males), were used in the recent DULCIS study. The present analysis compared the results obtained in the DULCIS with those that might have been had using the following different cutoff criteria: traditional cutoff for VTE exclusion, higher levels in subjects aged ≥60 years, or age multiplied by 10. Results: In young subjects, the DULCIS low cutoff levels resulted in half the recurrent events that would have occurred using the other criteria. In elderly patients, the DULCIS results were similar to those calculated for the two age-adjusted criteria. The adoption of traditional VTE exclusion criteria would have led to positive results in the large majority of elderly subjects, without a significant reduction in the rate of recurrent event. Conclusion: The results confirm the usefulness of the cutoff levels used in DULCIS.},

abstract = {Biosorption may be simply defined as the removal of substances from solution by biological material. Such substances can be organic and inorganic, and in gaseous, soluble or insoluble forms. Biosorption is a physico-chemical process and includes such mechanisms as absorption, adsorption, ion exchange, surface complexation and precipitation. Biosorption is a property of both living and dead organisms (and their components) and has been heralded as a promising biotechnology for pollutant removal from solution, and/or pollutant recovery, for a number of years, because of its efficiency, simplicity, analogous operation to conventional ion exchange technology, and availability of biomass. Most biosorption studies have carried out on microbial systems, chiefly bacteria, microalgae and fungi, and with toxic metals and radionuclides, including actinides like uranium and thorium. However, practically all biological material has an affinity for metal species and a considerable amount of other research exists with macroalgae (seaweeds) as well as plant and animal biomass, waste organic sludges, and many other wastes or derived bio-products. While most biosorption research concerns metals and related substances, including radionuclides, the term is now applied to particulates and all manner of organic substances as well. However, despite continuing dramatic increases in published research on biosorption, there has been little or no exploitation in an industrial context. This article critically reviews aspects of biosorption research regarding the benefits, disadvantages, and future potential of biosorption as an industrial process, the rationale, scope and scientific value of biosorption research, and the significance of biosorption in other waste treatment processes and in the environment.

abstract = {Ecosystem functions in streams (e.g., microbially mediated leaf litter breakdown) are threatened globally by the predicted agricultural intensification and its expansion into pristine areas, which is associated with increasing use of fertilizers and pesticides. However, the ecological consequences may depend on the disturbance history of microbial communities. To test this, we assessed the effects of fungicides and nutrients (four levels each) on the structural and functional resilience of leaf-associated microbial communities with differing disturbance histories (pristine vs. previously disturbed) in a 2 × 4 × 4-factorial design (n = 6) over 21 days. Microbial leaf breakdown was assessed as a functional variable, whereas structural changes were characterized by the fungal community composition, species richness, biomass, and other factors. Leaf breakdown by the pristine microbial community was reduced by up to 30{\%} upon fungicide exposure compared with controls, whereas the previously disturbed microbial community increased leaf breakdown by up to 85{\%}. This significant difference in the functional response increased in magnitude with increasing nutrient concentrations. A pollution-induced community tolerance in the previously disturbed microbial community, which was dominated by a few species with high breakdown efficacies, may explain the maintained function under stress. Hence, the global pressure on pristine ecosystems by agricultural expansion is expected to cause a modification in the structure and function of heterotrophic microbial communities, with microbially mediated leaf litter breakdown likely becoming more stable over time as a consequence of fungal community adaptions.},

The current study used water industry monitoring data collected over a two and a half-year period (2008–2011) to quantify the presence of metaldehyde in rivers and finished waters. Measured surface water concentrations were then compared with catchment characteristics in an attempt to identify those factors driving losses of the pesticide to water. An assessment was also made of the robustness of the monitoring strategy used, which was assumed to represent typical water industry practice, and is currently being used to develop catchment management plans. It was found that exceedance of the European Union pesticide standard (0.1 $\mu$g/L) during the October–December slug pellet application period is commonplace. Peak concentrations were generally in the 0.4–0.6 $\mu$g/L range although sometimes were an order of magnitude higher.},

abstract = {Most integral endpoints of the antimicrobial effect are determined over an arbitrarily chosen time period, such as the dosing interval (tau), regardless of the actual effect duration. Unlike the tau-related endpoints, the intensity of the antimicrobial effect (I(E)) does consider its duration-from time zero to the time when bacterial counts on the regrowth curve achieve the same maximal numbers as in the absence of the antimicrobial. To examine the possible impact of this fundamental difference on the relationships of the antimicrobial effect to the ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) to the MIC, a clinical isolate of Staphylococcus aureus was exposed to simulated gemifloxacin pharmacokinetics over a 40-fold range of AUC/MIC ratios, from 11 to 466 h. In each run, I(E) and four tau-related endpoints, including the area under the time-kill curve (AUBC), the area above the curve (AAC), the area between the control growth and time-kill curves (ABBC), and the ABBC related to the area under the control growth curve (AUGC), were calculated for tau = 24 h. Unlike the I(E), which displayed pseudolinear relationships with the AUC/MIC ratio; each tau-related endpoint showed a distinct saturation at potentially therapeutic AUC/MIC ratios (116 to 466 h) when the antimicrobial effect persisted longer than tau. This saturation results from the underestimation of the true effect and may be eliminated if ABBC, AAC, and AUBC (but not AUGC) are modified and determined in the same manner as the I(E) to consider the actual effect duration. These data suggest a marginal value of the tau-related endpoints as indices of the total antimicrobial effect. Since all of them respond to AUC/MIC ratio changes less than the I(E), the latter is preferable in comparative pharmacodynamic studies.},

Cells were gram-negative, motile, non-sporulating, straight to curved rods with a polar flagellum. The isolates exhibited phenotypic traits of members of the genus Stenotrophomonas, including cellular fatty acid composition and the limited range of substrates that could be used. Sugars and many amino acids were utilized. Antibiotic susceptibility and physiological characteristics were determined. The DNA base composition was 66.9 mol{\%} G+C. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the nearest relatives were Stenotrophomonas maltophilia LMG 11114, Stenotrophomonas nitritireducens DSM 12575T and Pseudomonas pictorum ATCC 23328T (similarity of 98.1-98.8{\%}). Xanthomonas species, S. maltophilia LMG 958T and Stenotrophomonas africana CIP 104854T showed high 16S rRNA sequence similarities (96.4-97.3{\%}). The high similarity found in cellular fatty acid profiles and identical partial 16S rRNA sequences (500 bp) for strains AMX 17 and AMX 19T indicate that they belong to the same species.

abstract = {Iron acquisition in aerobic habitats is complicated by the low solubility of ferric hydroxides. Siderophores that bind ferric iron with high affinity are used to mobilize iron. The reduction of ferric iron to the ferrous form can be coupled to the release of iron from siderophores. Iron is also stored intracellularly as a ferric mineral in proteins, such as ferritin, and must be reduced during release. In Escherichia coli, the yqjH gene encodes a putative ferric siderophore reductase that is also part of the Fur regulon. Here we show that YqjH has ferric reductase activity and is required for iron homeostasis in E. coli. Divergently transcribed from yqjH is the yqjI gene, which encodes a novel member of the winged-helix family of transcriptional regulators and also contains an N-terminal extension similar to the Ni(2+)-binding C-terminal tail of SlyD. Deletion of yqjI leads to constitutive high-level activity of the yqjH and yqjI promoters. Purified YqjI binds inverted repeat target sequences within the yqjH and yqjI promoters. We also observed that YqjI-dependent transcriptional repression is reduced when cells are exposed to elevated nickel levels, resulting in increased expression of yqjH and yqjI. YqjI binding to nickel or iron reduces YqjI DNA-binding activity in vitro. Furthermore, we found that elevated nickel stress levels disrupt iron homeostasis in E. coli and that deletion of yqjH increases nickel toxicity. Our results suggest that the YqjI protein controls expression of yqjH to help maintain iron homeostasis under conditions (such as elevated cellular nickel levels) that disrupt iron metabolism.},

abstract = {Recent progress in risk assessment of nickel carcinogenicity and its correlation with occupational lung cancer in nickel-exposed workers is reviewed. Epidemiological investigations provide reliable data indicating the close relation between nickel exposure and high lung cancer risk, especially in nickel refineries. The nickel species-specific effects and the dose-response relationship between nickel exposure and lung cancer are among the main questions that are explored extensively. It is also suggested that some confounding factors such as cigarette smoking cannot be neglected. The determination of nickel concentration in lung tissue may be conducive to estimating the nickel exposure level, but it is uncertain whether the high nickel content in lung tissue indicates high lung cancer risk in nickel-exposed workers. Immunologic studies suggest that the suppressive effect of nickel on NK cell activity and interferon production may also be involved in the mechanisms of nickel carcinogenesis. As a potential mutagen, nickel can cause chromosome damage both in vitro and in vivo; and on a molecular basis, nickel is found to induce DNA damage (DNA strandbreaks and crosslinks, infidelity of DNA replication, inhibition of DNA repair, and the helical transition of B-DNA to Z-DNA) by binding of nickel ions to DNA and nuclear proteins. The discovery of oncogene promises both a challenge and an opportunity for nickel carcinogenesis research. It can be predicted that, with the rapid development of molecular biology and oncology, new approaches will be established for both understanding and controlling nickel-induced occupational lung cancer.},

abstract = {The discovery in the early 1980s that soil microorganisms, and in particular the symbiotic bacteria Rhizobium, were highly sensitive to heavy metals initiated a new line of research. This has given us important insights into a range of topics: ecotoxicology, bioavailability of heavy metals, the role of soil biodiversity, and the existence of 'keystone' organisms. Concurrently, and particularly in Europe, the research led to new approaches to the protection of soils from pollution that take into account the many effects on soil microorganisms. To date these key findings have largely been ignored in the USA, although our results caused considerable controversy there. In the past decade there have been many advances in the ecotoxicological assessment of metals and their effects on soil organisms but major gaps in knowledge and theory remain with regard to how microorganisms are exposed and respond to metals in soils. In this brief review we emphasise the need for long-term experiments and basic research to forge this understanding and improve environmental protection policies. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

All rights reserved.Divalent nickel is found in most biologically relevant environments and, like all transition metals, has the potential to damage cells. As such, the mechanisms of nickel toxicity are fundamental to our understanding of the evolution of nickel regulation and defense that mitigates the toxic effects of this metal. While the diversity of bacterial ecology and cellular physiology can make the specific target of nickel toxicity variable, an increasing number of studies are beginning to delineate three themes of nickel toxicity: inhibition of metalloproteins, interaction with enzyme active-site His or Cys residues, and the potential to create or enhance oxidative stress. Due to this inherent toxicity, it is imperative that cells detect and defend themselves from toxic levels of nickel. In this chapter, we highlight the themes of nickel-dependent toxicity, regulation, and defense in bacteria.},

To understand the ecogenomic responses of sediment communities to the multiple stressors of polluted environments, the bacteria, protistan and metazoan communities in sediments from marine and adjacent riverine areas of North Bohai Sea were characterized by environmental DNA meta-systematics, and their associations with environmental variables were assessed by multiple statistical approaches. The bacterial communities were dominated by Firmicutes (mean 22.4{\%}), Proteobacteria (mean 21.6{\%}) and Actinobacteria (mean 21.5{\%}). The protistan communities were dominated by Ochrophyta (33.7{\%}), Cercozoa (18.9{\%}) and Ciliophora (17.9{\%}). Arthropoda (71.1{\%}) dominated the metazoan communities in sediments. The structures of communities in sediments were shaped by both natural variables (spatial variability and/or salinity (presented as Na and Ca)) and anthropogenic contaminants, including DDTs, PAHs or metals (Cu, Al, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Ni and Zn). Particularly, the correlation network of multiple communities was modulated by the concentrations of Na and DDTs at the family level. Overall, environmental DNA meta-systematics can provide a powerful tool for biomonitoring, sediment quality assessment, and key stressors identification.},

abstract = {Antibiotic use in the early 1900 vastly improved human health but at the same time started an arms race of antibiotic resistance. The widespread use of antibiotics has resulted in ubiquitous trace concentrations of many antibiotics in most environments. Little is known about the impact of these antibiotics on microbial processes or “non-target” organisms. This mini-review summarizes our knowledge of the effect of synthetically produced antibiotics on microorganisms involved in biogeochemical cycling. We found only 31 articles that dealt with the effects of antibiotics on such processes in soil, sediment, or freshwater. We compare the processes, antibiotics, concentration range, source, environment, and experimental approach of these studies. Examining the effects of antibiotics on biogeochemical processes should involve environmentally relevant concentrations (instead of therapeutic), chronic exposure (versus acute), and monitoring of the administered antibiotics. Furthermore, the lack of standardized tests hinders generalizations regarding the effects of antibiotics on biogeochemical processes. We investigated the effects of antibiotics on biogeochemical N cycling, specifically nitrification, denitrification, and anammox. We found that environmentally relevant concentrations of fluoroquinolones and sulfonamides could partially inhibit denitrification. So far, the only documented effects of antibiotic inhibitions were at therapeutic doses on anammox activities. The most studied and inhibited was nitrification (25–100 {\%}) mainly at therapeutic doses and rarely environmentally relevant. We recommend that firm conclusions regarding inhibition of antibiotics at environmentally relevant concentrations remain difficult due to the lack of studies testing low concentrations at chronic exposure. There is thus a need to test the effects of these environmental concentrations on biogeochemical processes to further establish the possible effects on ecosystem functioning. {\textcopyright} 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg},

Results were consistent across seasons and geographic locations. On average, algal biomass was suppressed by 22{\%}, 4{\%}, 22{\%}, and 18{\%} relative to controls by caffeine, ciprofloxacin, diphenhydramine, and the mixed treatment, respectively. Biofilm respiration was significantly suppressed by caffeine (53{\%}), cimetidine (51{\%}), ciprofloxacin (91{\%}), diphenhydramine (63{\%}), and the mixed treatment (40{\%}). In autumn in New York, photosynthesis was also significantly suppressed by diphenhydramine (99{\%}) and the mixed treatment (88{\%}). Pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA genes was used to examine the effects of caffeine and diphenhydramine on biofilm bacterial community composition at the three sites. Relative to the controls, diphenhydramine exposure significantly altered bacterial community composition and resulted in significant relative increases in Pseudomonas sp. and decreases in Flavobacterium sp. in all three streams. These ubiquitous pharmaceuticals, alone or in combination, influenced stream biofilms, which could have consequences for higher trophic levels and important ecosystem processes.},

abstract = {Traditional approaches to ecotoxicology and ecological risk assessment frequently have ignored the complexities arising due to the spatial heterogeneity of natural systems. In recent years, however, ecologists have become increasingly aware of the influence of spatial organization on ecological processes. Landscape ecology provides a conceptual and theoretical framework for the analysis of spatial patterns, the characterization of spatial aspects of ecosystem function, and the understanding of landscape dynamics. Incorporating the insights of landscape ecology into ecotoxicology will enhance our ability to understand and ultimately predict the effects of toxic substances in ecological systems. Ecological risk assessments need to explicitly consider multiple spatial scales, accounting for heterogeneity within contaminated areas and for the larger landscape context. A simple simulation model is presented to illustrate the effects of spatial heterogeneity by linking an individual-based toxicokinetic model with a spatially distributed metapopulation model. Dispersal of organisms between contaminated and uncontaminated patches creates a situation where risk analysis must consider a spatial extent broader than the toxicant-contaminated area. In general, the addition of a toxicant to a source patch (i.e., a net exporter of individuals) will have a greater impact than the same toxicant addition to a sink patch (i.e., a net importer of individuals).},

abstract = {Microbiological metal toxicity involves redox reactions between metal species and cellular molecules, and therefore, we hypothesized that antioxidant systems might be chromosomal determinants affecting the susceptibility of bacteria to metal toxicity. Here, survival was quantified in metal ion-exposed planktonic cultures of several Escherichia coli strains, each bearing a mutation in a gene important for redox homeostasis. This characterized approximately 250 gene-metal combinations and identified that sodA, sodB, gor, trxA, gshA, grxA and marR have distinct roles in safeguarding or sensitizing cells to different toxic metal ions (Cr(2)O(7)(2-), Co(2+), Cu(2+), Ag(+), Zn(2+), AsO(2)(-), SeO(3)(2-) or TeO(3)(2-)). To shed light on these observations, fluorescent sensors for reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reduced thiol (RSH) quantification were used to ascertain that different metal ions exert oxidative toxicity through disparate modes-of-action. These oxidative mechanisms of metal toxicity were categorized as involving ROS and thiol-disulfide chemistry together (AsO(2)(-), SeO(3)(2-)), ROS predominantly (Cu(2+), Cr(2)O(7)(2-)) or thiol-disulfide chemistry predominantly (Ag(+), Co(2+), Zn(2+), TeO(3)(2-)). Corresponding to this, promoter-luxCDABE fusions showed that toxic doses of different metal ions up- or downregulate the transcription of gene sets marking distinct pathways of cellular oxidative stress. Altogether, our findings suggest that different metal ions are lethal to cells through discrete pathways of oxidative biochemistry, and moreover, indicate that chromosomally encoded antioxidant systems may have metal ion-specific physiological roles as determinants of bacterial metal tolerance.},

abstract = {Pharmaceuticals derived from manufacturing and human consumption contaminate surface waters worldwide. To what extent such pharmaceutical contamination accumulates and disperses over time in different compartments of aquatic food webs is not well known. In this study we assess to what extent five pharmaceuticals (diphenhydramine, oxazepam, trimethoprim, diclofenac, and hydroxyzine) are taken up by fish (European perch) and four aquatic invertebrate taxa (damselfly larvae, mayfly larvae, waterlouse, and ramshorn snail), by tracing their bioconcentrations over several months in a semi-natural large-scale (pond) system. The results suggest both significant differences among drugs in their capacity to bioaccumulate and differences among species in uptake. While no support for in situ uptake of diclofenac and trimethoprim was found, oxazepam, diphenhydramine, and hydroxyzine were detected in all analyzed species. Here, the highest bioaccumulation factor (tissue:water ratio) was found for hydroxyzine. In the food web, the highest concentrations were found in the benthic species ramshorn snail and waterlouse, indicating that bottom-living organism at lower trophic positions are the prime receivers of the pharmaceuticals. In general, concentrations in the biota decreased over time in response to decreasing water concentrations. However, two interesting exceptions to this trend were noted. First, mayfly larvae (primarily grazers) showed peak concentrations (a fourfold increase) of oxazepam, diphenhydramine, and hydroxyzine about 30 days after initial addition of pharmaceuticals. Second, perch (top-predator) showed an increase in concentrations of oxazepam throughout the study period. Our results show that drugs can remain bioavailable for aquatic organism for long time periods (weeks to months) and even re-enter the food web at a later time. As such, for an understanding of accumulation and dispersion of pharmaceuticals in aquatic food webs, detailed ecological knowledge is required.},

abstract = {During the last three decades, the impact of chemical pollution has focused almost exclusively on the conventional "priority" pollutants, especially those acutely toxic/carcinogenic pesticides and industrial intermediates displaying persistence in the environment. This spectrum of chemicals, however, is only one piece of the larger puzzle in "holistic" risk assessment. Another diverse group of bioactive chemicals receiving comparatively little attention as potential environmental pollutants includes the pharmaceuticals and active ingredients in personal care products (in this review collectively termed PPCPs), both human and veterinary, including not just prescription drugs and biologics, but also diagnostic agents, "nutraceuticals," fragrances, sun-screen agents, and numerous others. These compounds and their bioactive metabolites can be continually introduced to the aquatic environment as complex mixtures via a number of routes but primarily by both untreated and treated sewage. Aquatic pollution is particularly troublesome because aquatic organisms are captive to continual life-cycle, multigenerational exposure. The possibility for continual but undetectable or unnoticed effects on aquatic organisms is particularly worrisome because effects could accumulate so slowly that major change goes undetected until the cumulative level of these effects finally cascades to irreversible change-change that would otherwise be attributed to natural adaptation or ecologic succession. As opposed to the conventional, persistent priority pollutants, PPCPs need not be persistent if they are continually introduced to surface waters, even at low parts-per-trillion/parts-per-billion concentrations (ng-pg/L). Even though some PPCPs are extremely persistent and introduced to the environment in very high quantities and perhaps have already gained ubiquity worldwide, others could act as if they were persistent, simply because their continual infusion into the aquatic environment serves to sustain perpetual life-cycle exposures for aquatic organisms. This review attempts to synthesize the literature on environmental origin, distribution/occurrence, and effects and to catalyze a more focused discussion in the environmental science community. Summary Risks associated with previously unknown, unrecognized, unanticipated, or unsuspected chemical pollutants in the environment have long been a major concern of environmental scientists. The importance of identifying such emerging risks is reflected in one of the top five goals of the Strategic Plan 2000 for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (U.S. EPA) Office of Research and Development. Early identification and investigation of potential environmental pollution issues before they worsen are critical for protecting ecologic and human health. It is also impor-tant to rule out issues that could be of concern but prove otherwise, so that limited resources can be redirected. Ecosystem change is effected by human activities primarily via three routes: habitat fragmentation, alteration of community structure (e.g., via nonindige-nous species), and chemical pollution. The scope of the former two is highly delineated and obvious compared with the latter. During the last three decades, the impact of chemical pollution has focused almost exclusively on the conventional "priority" pollutants. This},

abstract = {The microbial communities in urban stream ecosystems are subject to complex combinations of stressors. These same microbial communities perform the critical ecosystem service of removing excess reactive nitrogen. We asked whether the denitrifying microbial communities in urban streams differ in their functional resistance to common urban stressors from communities from nonurban streams. We exposed inocula from a highly polluted urban stream and a nearby nonurban stream to three different stressors, added alone and in combination. Stressors represent the common urban impacts of thermal pollution (10°C), trace metal exposure (ionic silver (Ag+)), and salinization (addition of NaCl). We used reduction in nitrite (NO2 −) concentrations under anaerobic conditions as a proxy for denitrification potential. Nonurban stream denitrifying microbial communities were more diverse than their urban counterparts. Denitrification potential for both communities was unaffected by exposure to any individual stressor. However, denitrification rates by the less diverse urban microbial inoculum decreased in response to combined heavy metal and salt stress, while nonurban communities were unaffected. These findings support the hypothesis that higher diversity may confer greater functional resistance in response to multiple stressors and do not support the idea that stressful conditions select for communities that are functionally resilient to multiple stressors.},

abstract = {Species diversity is a major determinant of ecosystem productivity, stability, invasibility, and nutrient dynamics. Hundreds of studies spanning terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecosystems show that high-diversity mixtures are approximately twice as productive as monocultures of the same species and that this difference increases through time. These impacts of higher diversity have multiple causes, including interspecific complementarity, greater use of limiting resources, decreased herbivory and disease, and nutrient-cycling feedbacks that increase nutrient stores and supply rates over the long term. These experimentally observed effects of diversity are consistent with predictions based on a variety of theories that share a common feature: All have trade-off-based mechanisms that allow long-term coexistence of many different competing species. Diversity loss has an effect as great as, or greater than, the effects of herbivory, fire, drought, nitrogen addition, elevated CO2, and other drivers of environmental change. The preservation, conservation, and restoration of biodiversity should be a high global priority.},

abstract = {Environmental risks of chemicals are still often assessed substance-by-substance, neglecting mixture effects. This may result in risk underestimations, as the typical exposure is toward multicomponent chemical "cocktails". We use the two well established mixture toxicity concepts (Concentration Addition (CA) and Independent Action (IA)) for providing a tiered outline for environmental hazard and risk assessments of mixtures, focusing on general industrial chemicals and assuming that the "base set" of data (EC50s for algae, crustaceans, fish) is available. As mixture toxicities higher than predicted by CA are rare findings, we suggest applying CA as a precautious first tier, irrespective of the modes/mechanisms of action of the mixture components. In particular, we prove that summing up PEC/PNEC ratios might serve as a justifiable CA-approximation, in order to estimate in a first tier assessment whether there is a potential risk for an exposed ecosystem if only base-set data are available. This makes optimum use of existing single substance assessments as more demanding mixture investigations are requested only if there are first indications of an environmental risk. Finally we suggest to call for mode-of-action driven analyses only if error estimations indicate the possibility for substantial differences between CA- and IA-based assessments.},

abstract = {Many studies have aimed to understand food webs by investigating components such as trophic links (one consumer taxon eats one resource taxon), tritrophic interactions (one consumer eats an intermediate taxon, which eats a resource), or longer chains of links. We show here that none of these components (links, tritrophic interactions, and longer chains), individually or as an ensemble, accounts fully for the properties of the next higher level of organization. As a cell is more than its molecules, as an organ is more than its cells, and as an organism is more than its organs, in a food web, new structure emerges at every organizational level up to and including the whole web. We demonstrate the emergence of properties at progressively higher levels of structure by using all of the directly observed, appropriately organized, publicly available food web datasets with relatively complete trophic link data and with average body mass and population density data for each taxon. There are only three such webs, those of Tuesday Lake, Michigan, in 1984 and 1986, and Ythan Estuary, Scotland. We make the data freely available online with this report. Differences in web patterns between Tuesday Lake and Ythan Estuary, and similarities of Tuesday Lake in 1984 and 1986 despite 50{\%} turnover of species, suggest that the patterns we describe respond to major differences between ecosystem types.},

abstract = {Toxicants and other, non-chemical environmental stressors contribute to the global biodiversity crisis. Examples include the loss of bees and the reduction of aquatic biodiversity. Although non-compliance with regulations might be contributing, the widespread existence of these impacts suggests that for example the current approach of pesticide risk assessment fails to protect biodiversity when multiple stressors concurrently affect organisms. To quantify such multiple stress effects, we analysed all applicable aquatic studies and found that the presence of environmental stressors increases individual sensitivity to toxicants (pesticides, trace metals) by a factor of up to 100. To predict this dependence, we developed the "Stress Addition Model" (SAM). With the SAM, we assume that each individual has a general stress capacity towards all types of specific stress that should not be exhausted. Experimental stress levels are transferred into general stress levels of the SAM using the stress-related mortality as a common link. These general stress levels of independent stressors are additive, with the sum determining the total stress exerted on a population. With this approach, we provide a tool that quantitatively predicts the highly synergistic direct effects of independent stressor combinations.},
